## Description
Here we want to use machine learning methods, mainly to build a LSTM-RNN model, to realize an automated prediction for index price using historical daily price data. The model would mainly help investors in asset allocation and portfolio construc- tion. Stock-level predictive characteristics and macro-economical factors could be added on the base of our model to build more complicated ones for stock price prediction or to improve performance.

## Dataset used
We load daily price data of 49 indexes from Bloomberg terminal and cleaned data is attached as "dt_2001_clean.csv". Of course you can also scrape data from online sources like Yahoo Finance.
