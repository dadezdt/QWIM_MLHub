## Description
Relative to traditional empirical methods in asset pricing, machine learning accommodates a far more expansive
list of potential predictor variables, as well as richer specifications of functional form. Machine learning methods
can be successfully applied to the two canonical problems of empirical asset pricing: predicting returns in the cross
section and time series.

This project will do some work contributing ML applications in empirical asset pricing.
