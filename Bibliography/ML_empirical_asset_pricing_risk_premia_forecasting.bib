  abstract             = {This article argues that current smart-beta investment approaches provide only a partial answer to the main shortcomings of capitalization-weighted indices and develops a new approach to equity investing, which the authors refer to as smart-factor investing. The authors then provide an assessment of the benefits of simultaneously addressing the two main problems of cap-weighted indices their undesirable factor exposures and their heavy concentration by constructing factor indices that explicitly seek exposures to rewarded risk factors, while diversifying away unrewarded risks.

The results suggest that such smart-factor indices lead to considerable improvements in risk-adjusted performance. For long-term U.S. data, smart-factor indices for a range of different factor tilts consistently outperform cap-weighted, factor-tilted indices. Compared with the broad cap-weighted index, smart-factor indices roughly double the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio).

Outperformance of such indices persists at levels ranging from 2.92 percent to 4.46 percent annually, even when assuming unrealistically high transaction costs. Moreover, by providing explicit tilts to consensual factors, such indices improve upon many current smart-beta offerings where, more often than not, factor tilts exist as unintended consequences of ad hoc methodologies.},

  title        = {What Risk Premium is Normal?},
  abstract     = {We are in an industry that thrives on the expedient of forecasting the future by extrapolating the past. As a consequence, investors have grown accustomed to the idea that stocks normally produce an 8 percent real return and a 5 percent risk premium over bonds, compounded annually over many decades. Why? Because long-term historical returns have been in this range, with impressive consistency. Because investors see these same long-term historical numbers, year after year, these expectations are now embedded into the collective psyche of the investment community. Both figures are unrealistic from current market levels. Few have acknowledged that an important part of the lofty real returns of the past has stemmed from rising valuation levels and from high dividend yields which have since diminished.

As this article will demonstrate, the long-term forward-looking risk premium is nowhere near the 5 percent of the past; indeed, it may well be near-zero today, perhaps even negative. Credible studies, in the US and overseas, are now challenging this flawed conventional view, in well-researched studies by Claus and Thomas [2001] and Fama and French [2000, Working Paper], to name just two. Similarly, the long-term forward-looking real return from stocks is nowhere near history s 8 percent.

Our argument will show that, barring unprecedented economic growth or unprecedented growth in earnings as a percentage of the economy, real stock returns will probably be roughly 2-4 similar to bonds. Indeed, even this low real return figure assumes that current near-record valuation levels are fair, and likely to remain this high in the years ahead. Reversion to the mean would push future real returns lower still. Furthermore, if we examine the historical record, neither the 8 percent real return nor the 5 percent risk premium for stocks relative to government bonds has ever been a realistic expectation (except from major market bottoms or at times of crisis, such as wartime). Should investors require an 8 percent real return, or should a 5 percent risk premium be necessary to induce an investor to bear stock market risk? These returns and risk premiums are so grand that investors should perhaps have bid them away a long time ago - indeed, they may have done so in the immense bull market of 1982-1999.

Intuition suggests that investors should not require such outsize returns, and the historical evidence supports this view. This is a topic meriting careful exploration. After all, according to the Ibbotson data, investors earned 8 percent real returns over the past 75 years, and stocks have outpaced bonds by nearly 5 percent over the past 75 years. So, why shouldn t investors have expected these returns in the past and why shouldn t they continue to do so? Expressed in a slightly different way, we examine two questions.

First, can we derive an objective estimate of what investors should have had good reasons to have expected in the past? And, why should we expect less in the future than we ve earned in the past?

The answers to both questions lie in the difference between the observed excess return and the prospective risk premium, two fundamentally different concepts that unfortunately carry the same label, risk premium. If we distinguish between past excess returns and future expected risk premiums, it is not at all unreasonable that the future risk premiums should be different from past excess returns. This is a complex topic, requiring several careful steps to evaluate correctly. To gauge the risk premium for stocks relative to bonds, we need an expected real stock return and an expected real bond return.

To gauge the expected real bond return, we need both bond yields and an estimate of expected inflation through history. To gauge the expected real stock return, we need both stock dividend yields and an estimate of expected real dividend growth. Accordingly, we go through each of these steps, in reverse order, to form the building blocks for the final goal: an estimate of the objective, forward-looking equity risk premium, relative to bonds, through history.},

One of the commonly used estimates of expected inflation is the yield differential between nominal bonds and inflation-indexed bonds (breakeven inflation). Breakeven inflation is however a biased estimate of expected inflation because it includes an inflation risk premium (IRP). The novelty of our approach is that we estimate the IRP using the volatility implied from foreign exchange (FX) option prices combined with a price of risk extracted from stock prices. Purchasing Power Parity theory provides the linkage between inflation and the foreign exchange rate.

Using data from the Israeli government bond market, which has a long history of liquid markets in inflation-linked and nominal bonds as well as an active FX options market, we find a statistically and economically significant positive inflation risk premium.},

Moreover, the slope of the term structure is strongly linked to economic activity. Second, returns to the Treasury variance swap are negative and economically large. Shorting a variance swap produces an annualized Sharpe ratio of almost two and the associated returns cannot be explained by standard risk factors.

We find that the convergence of the OLS two-pass estimator depends critically on the time series sample size in addition to the number of cross-sections. To accommodate typical relatively small time series length, we propose new OLS and GLS estimators that improve the small sample performances significantly.},

  abstract             = {The traditional asset allocation to equities and bonds is characterized by high volatility and lacks sufficient diversification, particularly during periods of distress. The meltdown of 2001-2002, in which markets around the world tumbled together, amply demonstrated this fact. As a consequence, there has been a gradual shift in strategic allocations towards alternative asset classes, such as private equity, hedge funds and commodities. Unfortunately, these new allocations only partially provide the needed diversification. Several researchers, including Asness, Krail, and Liew [2001] and Anson [2007], have shown that even alternative asset classes are exposed to traditional equities and bonds.In an ideal world, a portfolio would be composed of a wide range of return-producing units, each of which is risky but independent of the others. Such a portfolio would result in high returns with low volatility. These return-producing units would also have capacity large enough for allocations by large funds. So, where do we find such independent, return-producing units? One simple answer is that many of these return-producing elements or risk premia already exist in traditional asset class portfolios. However, they are accompanied and dominated by broad equity or bond returns. We only need to separate them.The objective of this paper is to explore risk premia as basic units in investment management. First, we define and classify risk premia. We then identify a number of premia across different asset classes and discuss how an investor may capture them. Next, we study their risk and return characteristics, both as standalone entities and in a portfolio context. Lastly, we illustrate the potential benefits of building a portfolio of risk premia for asset allocation.},

In addition, we contribute to the literature by estimating the term structure of inflation risk premia implied from the TIPS market. The empirical evidence using data from the period of January 1998 through October 2007 indicates that the expected inflation rate, contrary to data derived from the consumer price indices, is very stable and the inflation risk premia exhibit a positive term structure.},

The factors are constructed using partial least squares and hence encapsulate only those components driving the forward moments that are also relevant for forecasting purposes. Empirically, we show that both factors exhibit significant in-sample and out-of-sample predictability for the equity and the variance premium. More importantly, the forward skewness factor exhibits equity premium predictability that is stronger than and incremental to that offered by the forward variance factor. This is not true in the case of the variance premium predictability.},

Extrapolating the past is the easiest, and worst, way to forecast the future. Unfortunately, most investors' return expectations are shaped by a simple extrapolation of either recent or long-term past returns. If, instead, the constituent parts of equity market returns are examined, we find that it is remarkably difficult to make a case for a positive equity risk premium (the premium of future stock market returns relative to bond yields) from current market levels. None of this analysis is contingent on any assumption that market P/E ratios or dividend yields should return to historical levels. If market levels are fair and are fully sustained in the years ahead, there is still little or no room for a positive equity risk premium. If there is not a positive risk premium, then actuarial return assumptions are likely to be too optimistic, with far-reaching implications for pension funding ratios, corporate earnings, future pension contributions, and appropriate asset allocation policy.},

In particular, they find that taking on downside risk is not always systematically rewarded.

  abstract             = {This article develops a model that takes into account skewness risk in risk parity portfolios. In this framework, asset returns are viewed as stochastic processes with jumps or random variables generated by a Gaussian mixture distribution. This dual representation allows us to show that skewness and jump risks are equivalent. As the mixture representation is simple, we obtain analytical formulas for computing asset risk contributions of a given portfolio. Therefore, we define risk budgeting portfolios and derive existence and uniqueness conditions. We then apply our model to the equity/bond/volatility asset mix policy. When assets exhibit jump risks like the short volatility strategy, we show that skewness-based risk parity portfolios produce better allocation than volatility-based risk parity portfolios. Finally, we illustrate how this model is suitable to manage the skewness risk of long-only equity factor portfolios and to allocate between alternative risk premia.},

  abstract             = {The popularity of alternative risk premia (ARP) is growing and strategies that focus on ARP are increasingly being incorporated into institutional portfolios. The attraction of this approach is that ARP can mimic strategies that have historically only been available through hedge fund vehicles, but with more favourable liquidity and cost characteristics. However, as investors familiarise themselves with this newer universe of investment strategies, the disparity of results that is being delivered by these solutions in practice is raising some ques tions. This paper aims to highlight some of these variations, provide an explanation for them and to also provide some suggestions for investors considering this exciting new investment approach. In our view, there are three elements an investor should consider:

It is important to scrutinise a manager's definition of individual risk premia; despite being broadly categorised under the same name, we have found that risk premia can have significantly different performances across investment solutions.

The methodology that managers use to allocate between risk premia should be closely scrutinised; our observations have shown that even portfolios managed using "equal risk contributions" can be defined in a number of ways, which can have implications on the end re sult.

The benefits of diversifying across several alternative risk premia managers should be considered, as the resulting low correlation could help investors obtain improved risk- adjusted performance without significantly increasing their portfolio's bet a to traditional equity markets.},

  abstract             = {Equity risk premiums are a central component of every risk and return model in finance and are a key input in estimating costs of equity and capital in both corporate finance and valuation. Given their importance, it is surprising how haphazard the estimation of equity risk premiums remains in practice. We begin this paper by looking at the economic determinants of equity risk premiums, including investor risk aversion, information uncertainty and perceptions of macroeconomic risk. In the standard approach to estimating the equity risk premium, historical returns are used, with the difference in annual returns on stocks versus bonds over a long time period comprising the expected risk premium. We note the limitations of this approach, even in markets like the United States, which have long periods of historical data available, and its complete failure in emerging markets, where the historical data tends to be limited and volatile. We look at two other approaches to estimating equity risk premiums the survey approach, where investors and managers are asked to assess the risk premium and the implied approach, where a forward-looking estimate of the premium is estimated using either current equity prices or risk premiums in non-equity markets. In the next section, we look at the relationship between the equity risk premium and risk premiums in the bond market (default spreads) and in real estate (cap rates) and how that relationship can be mined to generated expected equity risk premiums. We close the paper by examining why different approaches yield different values for the equity risk premium, and how to choose the - right- number to use in analysis.},

  abstract     = {The equity risk premium (ERP) is an essential building block of the market value of risk. In theory, the collective action of all investors results in an equilibrium expectation for the return on the market portfolio excess of the risk-free return, the ERP. The ability of the valuation actuary to choose a sensible value for the ERP, whether as a required input to capital asset pricing model valuation, or any of its descendants, is as important as choosing risk-free rates and risk relatives (betas) to the ERP for the asset at hand. The historical realized ERP for the stock market appears to be at odds with pricing theory parameters for risk aversion. Since 1985, there has been a constant stream of research, each of which reviews theories of estimating market returns, examines historical data periods, or both. Those ERP value estimates vary widely from about 1 percent to about 9 based on a geometric or arithmetic averaging, short or long horizons, short- or long-run expectations, unconditional or conditional distributions, domestic or international data, data periods, and real or nominal returns. This paper examines the principal strains of the recent research on the ERP and catalogues the empirical values of the ERP implied by that research. In addition, the paper supplies several time series analyses of the standard Ibbotson Associates 1926-2002 ERP data using short Treasuries for the risk-free rate. Recommendations for ERP values to use in common actuarial valuation problems also are offered.},

The estimator uses simple weighted two-pass cross-sectional regressions, and we show its consistency and asymptotic normality under increasing cross-sectional and time series dimensions. We address consistent estimation of the asymptotic variance by hard thresholding, and testing for asset pricing restrictions induced by the no-arbitrage assumption. We derive the restrictions given by a continuum of assets in a multi-period economy under an approximate factor structure robust to asset repackaging. The empirical analysis on returns for about ten thousand U.S. stocks from July 1964 to December 2009 shows that risk premia are large and volatile in crisis periods. They exhibit large positive and negative strays from time-invariant estimates, follow the macroeconomic cycles, and do not match risk premia estimates on standard sets of portfolios. The asset pricing restrictions are rejected for a conditional four-factor model capturing market, size, value, and momentum effects.},

The term structure is always positively sloped, while funding liquidity premia and betas explain the high unconditional returns for all dividend claims. Alphas for short-dated dividend claims become negative, whereas alphas for long-dated claims seem to be positive. The term structure slope varies positively with the market risk premium, but it is never negative relative to the first contract - due to the nearly zero risk premium in the first maturity - and rarely hump-shaped in some empirical models. We demonstrate how the maturity term structure - the risk premium for dividend strips with different maturities - is connected to both the horizon term structure - linked to the variance swap term structure - and various funding liquidity measures. The risk premium is on average increasing with investment horizon, while the risk premium depends primarily on the short-horizon risk premium, implying that short-horizon investors are the marginal ones. All our results hold in the US, the UK, Europe and Japan. All these facts are consistent with, for instance, a long-run risk model with jump risks.},

This paper identifies a new modeling framework for equity indices and presents for the first time explicit analytical formulas for their VRP in a multivariate stochastic volatility setting, which includes multivariate non-Gaussian Ornstein--Uhlenbeck processes and Wishart processes. Moreover, we propose to incorporate contagion within the equity index via a multivariate Hawkes process and find that the resulting dynamics of the VRP represent a convincing alternative to the models studied in the literature up to date. We show that our new model can explain the key stylized facts of both equity indices and individual assets and their corresponding VRP, while some popular (multivariate) stochastic volatility models may fail.

In this chapter, we have extended the study of the VRP to include not only equity indices but also commodities, government bonds and currencies. Using volatility swap returns as a measure of the payoff to the VRP, we see that the returns to a short volatility position are correlated to the volatility of the underlying instrument and to other VRPs in the same asset class. We also find that the returns are relatively uncorrelated to the VRPs of other asset classes and to the traditional equity factors represented by pure factor portfolios (PFPs).

In this paper, we argue that the macro factors extracted by using the conventional PCA are not the most relevant for forecasting bond risk premium, because the PCA factors are designed to explain the most variation of macro data instead of the variation of bond risk premium. With the latter objective in mind, we propose a scaled PCA (sPCA) approach, which incorporates the information in bond risk premium in the factor extraction procedure. The real time sPCA factors have much stronger predictive power than the PCA factors, both in- and out-of-sample, and generate sizeable utility gains. Alterative approaches, target PCA and PLS, obtain similar results. The forecasting power of the sPCA factors appear countercycilical, with expected bond returns high in recessions and low in expansions. The sPCA factors also strongly forecast future macro data revision and macroeconomic conditions, consistent with implications of standard asset pricing theories.},

We relate this finding to other puzzling features of currency markets, namely that the real exchange rate contemporaneously appreciates with the interest rate differential and that the positive relationship between currency risk premia and the interest rate differential reverses over longer horizons. Models in which the currency risk premium depends on the interest rate differential and a missing risk premium, capturing deviations from the purchasing power parity, can rationalize these observations.},

Further, this liquidity risk is a priced factor for the expected returns on corporate bonds, and the associated liquidity risk premia help to explain the credit spread puzzle. In terms of expected returns, the total estimated liquidity risk premium is around 0.6 percent per annum for US long-maturity investment grade bonds. For speculative grade bonds, which have higher exposures to the liquidity factors, the liquidity risk premium is around 1.5 percent per annum.

We find very similar evidence for the liquidity risk exposure of corporate bonds for a sample of European corporate bond prices.},

Until now they have typically been handled as separate phenomena for specific markets or asset classes and thus examined independently. This study analyses risk premia across a variety of asset classes and risk styles to uncover their common performance characteristics, underlying risk sources and return's sensitivity to economic factors.

Based on a set of 16 risk premia over a 22 year sample period we were able to illustrate that risk premia's expected returns are significantly influenced by their volatility and their sensitivity to funding liquidity and market volatility. Furthermore we show that macroeconomic factors such as industrial production and inflation have a significant effect on the expected returns of the entire set of risk premia. Finally, analysing the link between premia and the global market portfolio shows that premia with unfavourable comoments possess superior expected returns.},

The estimation approach is arbitrage-free, largely model-free, and easy to implement. It also distinguishes between TIPS yields and real yields by explicitly taking into account the three-month indexation lag of TIPS in the analysis. In addition, we consider three measures of TIPS liquidity, including one new measure based on TIPS prices only.

We estimate the liquidity premium to be around 13 basis points over the full sample but substantially higher in the first subperiod. We find that the inflation risk premium is time-varying and, on average, considerably lower than suggested by various structural models. Depending on the proxy used for expected inflation, the unconditional 10-year inflation risk premium ranges from 9 basis points to 4 basis points over the full sample, and between 1 basis point and 6 basis points over the 2004 2008 subperiod.},

  abstract             = {The concept of alternative risk premia can be viewed as an extension of the factor investing approach. Factor investing is a term that is generally dedicated to long-only equity risk factors. A typical example is the value equity strategy. Alternative risk premia designate non-traditional risk premia other than long exposure to equities and bonds. They may concern equities, rates, credit, currencies or commodities and correspond to long/short portfolios. For instance, the value strategy can be extended to credit, currencies and commodities. This paper provides an overview of the different alternative risk premia to be found in the academic and professional spheres. Using a database of commercial indices, we estimate the generic cumulative returns of 59 alternative risk premia in order to analyze their risk, diversification power and payoff function. From this, it is clear that the term "alternative risk premia"encompasses two different types of risk factor: skewness risk premia and market anomalies. We then reconsider portfolio allocation in light of this framework. Indeed, we show that skewness aggregation is considerably more complex than volatility aggregation, and we illustrate that the volatility risk measure is less appropriate and pertinent when managing a portfolio with these risk premia. The development of alternative risk premia shall also affect the risk/return analysis of non-linear strategies, e.g. hedge fund strategies. In particular, using alternative risk factors instead of traditional risk factors leads to an extension of the alternative beta framework. Therefore, we apply the previously estimated risk premia to a universe of hedge fund indices. To that end, we develop a model selection based on the lasso regression to identify the most pertinent risk premia for each hedge fund strategy. It appears that many traditional risk factors, with the exception of long equity and credit exposure on developed markets, vanish when we include alternative risk premia.},

Our results indicate that, over the post-2004 period when index-linked bond markets were sufficiently developed in both monetary areas, inflation risk premia across various maturities had strikingly similar properties in the United States and in the euro area: their dynamics and their levels, especially over the years until mid-2011, have remained quite close to each other, even if premia appear to be subject to somewhat greater high-frequency volatility in the United States. After correcting for liquidity and inflation risk premia, long-term inflation expectations extracted from bond prices have remained remarkably stable at the peak of the financial crisis and throughout the Great Recession

. For the United States, we also document a downward shift in the perceived inflation target, from approximately 3 percent until 2011 to levels closer to 2 percent following the FOMC announcement of a numerical long-term inflation goal.},

We find that the skew premium accounts for over 40 percent of the slope in the implied volatility curve in the SandP 500 market. Skew risk is tightly related to variance risk, in the sense that strategies designed to capture the one and hedge out exposure to the other earn an insignificant risk premium. This provides a new testable restriction for asset pricing models trying to capture, in particular, disaster risk premiums. We base our results on a general trading strategy by replicating contracts that swap implied for realized conditional asset moments.},

Our paper fills this gap by comparing the predictive ability of technical indicators with that of macroeconomic variables. Technical indicators display statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power, matching or exceeding that of macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, technical indicators and macroeconomic variables provide complementary information over the business cycle: technical indicators better detect the typical decline in the equity risk premium near business-cycle peaks, whereas macroeconomic variables more readily pick up the typical rise in the equity risk premium near cyclical troughs. Consistent with this behavior, we show that combining information from both technical indicators and macroeconomic variables significantly improves equity risk premium forecasts versus using either type of information alone. Overall, the substantial countercyclical fluctuations in the equity risk premium appear well captured by the combined information in technical indicators and macroeconomic variables.},

We use the methodology of dynamic factor analysis for large datasets to investigate possible empirical linkages between forecastable variation in excess bond returns and macroeconomic fundamentals. We find that - real- and - inflation- factors have important forecasting power for future excess returns on U.S. government bonds, above and beyond the predictive power contained in forward rates and yield spreads. This behavior is ruled out by commonly employed affine term structure models where the forecastability of bond returns and bond yields is completely summarized by the cross-section of yields or forward rates. An important implication of these findings is that the cyclical behavior of estimated risk premia in both returns and long-term yields depends importantly on whether the information in macroeconomic factors is included in forecasts of excess bond returns. Without the macro factors, risk premia appear virtually acyclical, whereas with the estimated factors risk premia have a marked countercyclical component, consistent with theories that imply investors must be compensated for risks associated with macroeconomic activity.},

We demonstrate that fluctuations in risk premiums, and not risk-free rates and dividends, account for a large part of the observed equity price synchronization after 1990. We also show that U.S. monetary policy has come to play an important role as a source of fluctuations in risk appetite across global equity markets. These fluctuations are transmitted across both fixed and floating exchange rate regimes, but the effects are more muted in floating rate regimes.},

  abstract             = {This paper aims to extend the Fama and French (FF) three factor model in studying time varying risk premiums of Sector Select Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) under a Markov regime switching framework.

First, the original FF model is augmented to include three additional macro factors market volatility, yield spread, and credit spread. Then, the FF model is extended to a model with a Markov regime switching mechanism for bull, bear, and transition market regimes.

It is found that all market regimes are persistent, with the bull market regime being the most persistent, and the bear market regime being the least persistent. Both the risk premiums of the Sector Select ETFs and their sensitivities to the risk factors are highly regime dependent.

The regime switching model has a superior performance in capturing the risk sensitivities of the Sector Select ETFs, that would otherwise be missed by both the FF and the augmented FF models.

This is the first research on Sector Select ETFs with Markov regime switching.},

  abstract             = {Alternative Risk Premia (ARP) are systematic or rule-based strategies. They originate from the principle that investors should be rewarded for the sources of systematic risk they are exposed to. However, as opposed to traditional market risk factors to which anyone is familiar with, ARP must compensate investors for taking non-traditional risks. Equity size or volatility carry strategies are two examples of ARP. Allocation to ARP is yet not as straightforward as one thinks. Investors quickly realize that they not only have to decide to which risk premia they want to allocate capital but that they must also select the "indices" into which money will be directed. The latter problem sounds trivial a priori. Yet, it is not. First, the list of "indices" proposed by a series of different providers is quite long and it is not sure that indices that aim at capturing the same risk premium truly behave the same. Second, it is not because an index is proposed that it really mimics the performance of an existing risk premium. Stated otherwise, nothing guarantees that the performance achieved over time by an index is truly sustainable or persistent. It might be illusory and stemming from selection or overfitting bias. In this research paper, we perform a series of correlations and drawdown tests and apply clustering techniques to analyze the degree of homogeneity among the ARP indices. Our findings confirm the initial suspicion. Some indices show risk-return characteristics that are rather homogeneous indicating in turn that their underlying risk premia is well defined. FX carry for instance belongs to this category. Yet, results are not so clear-cut for others. Some indices are highly heterogeneous even if they claim to capture the same risk premium. Stated otherwise, performance is highly provider's dependent making the choice of an index an important component of the allocation process. Equity Value is an example. We then test for the existence of overfitting biases. We compare performance between "backtest" and "life" periods for a series of 255 indices. Results are indisputable. Performance decreases quasi-systematically once the ARP indices are launched, and the drop is severe. Investors should apply an 80\% discount on performance measures shown in a backtest if they wish to manage well their expectation. To summarize, this research paper shows that investors need to take no short cuts. When it comes to allocate capital to ARP, an extensive due diligence process is required to select both the indices and their providers.},

Consistent with this pattern, I find that dollar factor volatility risk is most significantly priced in the cross-section of volatility excess returns at shorter maturities. A trading strategy that sells (buys) volatility insurance on currencies with high (low) exposure to dollar factor volatility risk delivers high mean excess returns and Sharpe ratios. At shorter maturities, the profitability of this strategy cannot be explained by exposure to traditional currency factors, equity factors, or currency volatility carry factors.},

However, the maximum-likelihood practice, common with academics, of compounding at the estimator of mean return results in upward biased and highly inefficient estimates of long-term expected returns. We derive analytically both an unbiased and a small-sample efficient estimator of long-term expected returns for a given sample size and horizon. Both estimators entail penalties that reduce the annual compounding rate as the investment horizon increases. The unbiased estimator, which is far lower than the compounded arithmetic average, is still very inefficient, often more so than a simple geometric estimator known to practitioners. Our small-sample efficient estimator is even lower. These results compound the sobering evidence in recent work that the equity risk premium is lower than suggested by post-1926 data. Our methodology and results are robust to extensions such as predictable returns. We also confirm analytically that parameter uncertainty, properly incorporated, produces optimal asset allocations, in stark contrast to conventional wisdom. Longer investment horizons require lower, not higher, allocations to risky assets.},

Option and spot market information on the latent variance process is captured by using dual 'model-free' variance measures to define a bivariate observation equation in the state space model. The premium for variance diffusive risk is defined as linear in the latent variance (in the usual fashion) whilst the premium for variance jump risk is specified as a conditionally deterministic dynamic process, driven by a function of past measurements. The inferential approach adopted is Bayesian, implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that caters for the multiple sources of non-linearity in the model and for the bivariate measure. The method is applied to spot and option price data on the SandP 500 index from 1999 to 2008, with conclusions drawn about investors' required compensation for variance risk during the recent financial turmoil. The accuracy of the probabilistic forecasts of the observable variance measures is demonstrated, and compared with that of forecasts yielded by alternative methods. To illustrate the benefits of the approach, it is used to produce forecasts of prices of derivatives on volatility itself. In addition, the posterior distribution is augmented by information on daily returns to produce value at risk predictions. Linking the variance risk premia to the risk aversion parameter in a representative agent model, probabilistic forecasts of (approximate) relative risk aversion are also produced.},

Furthermore, Univariate ARMA and Exponential Smoothing models are also tested.The Market Risk Premium is defined as the historical differential between the return of the benchmark stock index over a short-term interest rate. Data are taken in daily frequency from January 2007 through December 2014. All these models outperform a Naive benchmark model. The Elman network outperforms all the other models during the insample period, whereas the MLP network provides superior results in the out-of-sample period.The contribution of this paper to the existing literature is twofold. First, it is the first study that attempts to forecast the Market Risk Premium in a daily basis using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Second, it is not based on a theoretical model but is mainly data driven. The chosen calculation approach fits quite well with the characteristics of ANNs. The forecasting model is tested with data from the US stock market. The proposed model-based forecasting method aims to capture patterns in the data that improve the forecasting accuracy of the Market Risk Premium in the tested market and indicates potential key metrics for investment and trading purposes for short time horizons.},

Although it is now well accepted that the average long-term performance of active mutual fund managers can to a large extent be replicated through a static exposure to traditional long-only risk premiums, an outstanding question remains with respect to the best possible approach for harvesting alternative long-short risk premiums.

The focus of this article is to empirically analyze (1) whether systematic rules-based strategies based on investable versions of traditional and alternative factors allow for satisfactory in-sample and out-of-sample replication of hedge fund performance, and more generally (2) whether suitably designed risk allocation strategies may provide a cost-efficient way for investors to get attractive exposure to alternative factors, regardless of whether they can be regarded as proxies for any particular hedge fund strategy. The main findings can be summarized as follows. On one hand, the authors find that replication models for hedge funds strategies generally achieve a relatively low out-of-sample explanatory power, regardless of the set of factors and the methodologies used. On the other hand, they that find that heuristic allocation strategies, such as risk parity strategies, applied to alternative risk factors could be a better alternative to hedge fund replication for efficiently harvesting alternative risk premiums.},

Besides the market excess return, momentum is the dominant driver for both skewness and kurtosis risk premia, which exhibit a highly significant negative correlation.

First, researchers have measured the margin by which equity total returns have exceeded fixed-income or cash returns over long historical periods and have projected this measure of the equity risk premium into the future. Second, the dividend discount model-or a variant of it, such as an earnings discount model-is used to estimate the future return on an equity index, and the fixed-income or cash yield is then subtracted to arrive at an equity risk premium expectation or forecast. Third, academics have used macroeconomic techniques to estimate what premium investors might rationally require for taking the risk of equities. Current thinking emphasizes the second, or dividend discount, approach and projects an equity risk premium centered on 3.5\% to 4\%.},

Maximum likelihood estimates show that the model describes the evolution of the nominal and real term structures by using three latent factors which can be interpreted as two real factors and one inflation factor. These provide important information on expected inflation and inflation risk premia.

The results highlight some striking differences between the euro area and the US. In the US, forward inflation risk premia become sizable around the start of the late-2000s financial crisis and considerably increase just before the adoption of the first unconventional monetary policy measures in March 2009. By contrast, in the euro area forward inflation risk premia remain unchanged even after the adoption of the unconventional monetary policy measures following the most acute phases of the financial crisis, in October 2008 and in May 2010. However, long-term inflation expectations have been well anchored over the past years.},

This paper shows the predictive relation is strongly related to the negative contemporaneous relation between returns and variance innovations, known as the leverage effect, in several ways. First, the predictive beta depends on how sensitive market returns react to unexpected changes in variance. These two betas are extremely close so that forecasts can be made accurately even when the predictive relation changes over time. In fact, when the contemporaneous variance beta is used as a slope for the VRP, one-month returns can be predicted out of sample in a statistically and economically significant manner. Second, the predictive power is determined by the correlation between returns and variance innovations. Moreover, this result is extendable to return predictions of other asset classes. In the cross-section of 21 currency returns, the VRP of the equity index can predict returns that highly correlates with changes in market variance. The predictive beta is connected to how much currency returns react to changes in variance.},

The results are of interest for practitioners who currently invest in or are thinking about investing in risk premia strategies. The study also makes a theoretical contribution since there currently is a lack of publicised work on this subject.

A combination of the statistical methods cluster tree, spanning tree and principal component analysis are used to first categorise the investigated risk premia strategies into different clusters based on their correlation characteristics and secondly to find the strategies' most important return drivers. Lastly, an analysis of how the clusters of strategies perform in different macroeconomic environments, here represented by inflation and growth, is conducted.

The results show that the three most important drivers for the investigated risk premia strategies are a crisis factor, an equity directional factor and an interest rate factor. These three components explained about 18 percent, 14 percent and 10 percent of the variation in the data, respectively.

The results also show that all four clusters, despite containing different types of risk premia strategies, experienced positive total returns during all macroeconomic phases sampled in this study. These results can be seen as indicative of a lower macroeconomic sensitivity among the risk premia strategies and more of an "alpha-like"behaviour.},

Liquidity risk rises during economic busts and remains low during economic booms. Break-even inflations overestimate expected inflation due to liquidity risk. The model implied-inflation expectations have the stronger forecast performance than any proposed data.

This paper decomposes the break-even inflation rates derived from inflation-indexed bonds into inflation risk premia, liquidity risk premia, and inflation expectations. I estimate a common factor model with autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic (ARCH) errors that extracts co-movements from twenty-two monthly and quarterly indicators to identify these three components.

The results indicate that the sharp declines in the 10-year and 5-year break-even inflation rates in 2009 reflect a substantial increase in liquidity risk rather than a decrease in inflation expectations. Break-even inflation rates underestimate inflation expectations over nearly the entire sample due to the liquidity risk premia carried by the inflation indexed bond yields.

Also, the model-implied inflation expectations show better forecast performance for the average annual inflation rates than raw break-even inflation rates, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Surveys of Consumers inflation forecasts.},

First, I use an unconditional asset pricing framework to construct an orthogonal shock in a macroeconomic VAR that best explains the cross-sectional variation in expected returns. The obtained lambda-shock closely resembles identified monetary policy surprises and does not explain the recent US recessions. Second, I integrate return-forecasting methods to construct a second shock in the VAR, which best explains time-variation in expected returns. The obtained gamma-shock turns out to be virtually orthogonal to the lambda-shock, closely resembles demand-type financial shocks identified by macroeconomists, and explains most US recessions. I find that the lambda-shock and the gamma-shock jointly explain up to 80\% of aggregate consumption fluctuations in the US.},

This paper studies whether the evident statistical predictability of bond risk premia translates into economic gains for investors. We propose a novel estimation strategy for affine term structure models that jointly fits yields and bond excess returns, thereby capturing predictive information otherwise hidden to standard estimations. The model predicts excess returns with high regression R2s and high forecast accuracy but cannot outperform the expectations hypothesis out-of-sample in terms of economic value, showing a general contrast between statistical and economic metrics of forecast evaluation. More specifically, the model mostly generates positive (negative) economic value during times of high (low) macroeconomic uncertainty. Overall, the expectations hypothesis remains a useful benchmark for investment decisions in bond markets, especially in low uncertainty states.},

Factor investing consists of building long-only equity portfolios which are directly exposed to common risk factors such as size, value or momentum. ARP designate non-traditional risk premia other than a long exposure to equities and bonds. They may involve equities, rates, credit, currencies or commodities and correspond to long-short portfolios. However, contrary to traditional risk premia, it is more difficult to define ARP in terms of which risk premia really matter. In fact, the term "alternative risk premia" encompasses two different types of systematic risk factor: skewness risk premia and market anomalies. For example, the most frequent ARP are carry and momentum, which are, respectively, a skewness risk premium and a market anomaly. Because the returns of ARP exhibit heterogeneous patterns in terms of statistical properties, option profiles and drawdown, asset allocation is more complex than with traditional risk premia. In this context, risk diversification cannot be reduced to volatility diversification and skewness risk becomes a key component of portfolio optimization. Understanding these different concepts and how they interconnect is essential for improving multi-asset allocation.},

In the Korean market, for example, even the portfolios of high-risk stocks recorded a loss of about 70\% between 2000 and 2016. In this study, we construct a low-risk portfolio that responds to low-risk anomalies in the Korean market using the Black-Litterman framework. We use three machine-learning predictive and traditional time-series models to predict the volatility of assets listed in the Korean Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI 200) and select the best-performing one. Then, we use the model to classify assets into high- and low-risk groups and create a Black-Litterman portfolio that reflects the investor's view where low-risk stocks outperform high-risk stocks. The experiment shows that reflecting the low-risk view in the market equilibrium portfolio improves profitability and that this view dominates the market portfolio.},

As a point of reference, we also provide a similar comparison in a linear predictive regression model without regime switching. Overall, our results do not support the contention of higher power in longer horizon tests in either the linear or nonlinear regime switching models. Nonetheless, it is possible that other plausible nonlinear models provide stronger justification for long-horizon tests. Using finite sample simulation methods, we assess the power of long-horizon predictive tests and compare them to their short-run counterparts, when the true underlying model contains financial asset bubbles. Our results indicate that long-run predictive test using valuation predictors -- specifically the dividend price ratio-- do pick up the return predictability inherent in the asset bubbles. However, after size-adjustment, the long-run predictive framework has a small advantage over its short-run counterpart when the predictor is highly persistent and provides a larger, yet still modest power improvement when the predictor is moderately persistent. The third chapter proposes a simple Bayesian learning framework to assess leverage ratios in the presence of parameter uncertainty about mean log cash flow. In particular it can explain why firm's leverage ratios have been observed to increase with firm age. Market values are increasing in uncertainty about mean cash flow and leverage ratios are decreasing with market values. Over the life period of firm, the managers and investors rationally learn from realized cash flows. Due to the convex relationship between cash flow and firm value, ceteris paribus, this results in a decrease in market value and an increase in the leverage ratio. Firm level panel data provides empirical evidence consistent with the model predictions after correcting for the endogeneity of the book to market and profitability control variates. The empirical results suggest that the firm leverage ratio increases over firm age due to learning.},

  abstract       = {Hundreds of anomaly variables have been proposed, claiming explanatory power to the cross-section of average returns in equity market. Cochrane (2011) dubs this phenomenon the "factor zoo" and further argues that the characteristic related factors to explain the average returns are in disarray. This paper introduces a newly developed machine learning tool, ordered and weighted L1 norm regularisation (OWL) to "regularise" this chaotic "factor zoo". The innovation of OWL is that high correlations among explanatory variables are permitted. Highly correlated variables will be identified and grouped together, while useless/redundant variables will be shrunk off simultaneously. This is important because factor correlation prevails in high dimensionality and biases standard estimators (FM regression, LA, etc.). Monte Carlo experiments show OWL outperforms LA, adaptive LA and Elastic Net in various settings, particularly when factors are highly correlated. Empirical evidence suggests that 'liquidity' related factors are primary to drive asset prices. Following Freyberge et al. (2017), out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of hedge portfolio, formed using OWL selected factors as predictors in the past two decades, is around 3.5 (annualised) considering all stocks, and around 2.3 when excluding micro stocks.},

In order to take advantage of the rapid, subtle movement of assets in High Frequency Trading (HFT), an automatic algorithm to analyze and detect patterns of price change based on transaction records must be available. The multichannel, time-series representation of financial data naturally suggests tensor-based learning algorithms. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of two multilinear methods for the mid-price prediction problem against other existing methods. The experiments in a large scale dataset which contains more than 4 millions limit orders show that by utilizing tensor representation, multilinear models outperform vector-based approaches and other competing ones.},

Most importantly, the literature review gives the reader a theoretical overview of the most recent academic studies in empirical asset pricing that employ machine learning techniques.

Examples of successful application can be found in speech recognition and machine translation. There exist relative few finance articles were deep learning have been applied, but existing articles indicate that deep learning can be successfully applied to problems in finance.

This thesis studies forecasting of financial price movements using two types of neural networks, namely; feedforward and recurrent networks. For the feedforward neural networks we considered non-deep networks with more neurons and deep networks with fewer neurons. In addition to the comparison between feedforward and recurrent networks, a comparison between deep and non-deep networks will be made. The recurrent architecture consists of a recurrent layer mapping into a feedforward layer followed by an output layer. The networks are trained with two different feature setups, one less complex and one more complex.

The findings for non-deep vs. deep feedforward neural networks imply that there does not exist any general pattern whether deep or non-deep networks are preferable. The findings for recurrent neural networks vs. feedforward neural networks imply that recurrent neural networks do not necessarily outperform feedforward neural networks even though financial data in general are time-dependent. In some cases, adding batch normalization can improve the accuracy for the feedforward neural networks. This can be preferable instead of using more complex models, such as a recurrent neural networks. Moreover, there are significant differences in accuracies between using the two different feature setups. The highest accuracy for all networks are 52.82\%, which is significantly better than the simple benchmark.},

In the Korean market, for example, even the portfolios of high-risk stocks recorded a loss of about 70\% between 2000 and 2016. In this study, we construct a low-risk portfolio that responds to low-risk anomalies in the Korean market using the Black-Litterman framework. We use three machine-learning predictive and traditional time-series models to predict the volatility of assets listed in the Korean Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI 200) and select the best-performing one. Then, we use the model to classify assets into high- and low-risk groups and create a Black-Litterman portfolio that reflects the investor's view where low-risk stocks outperform high-risk stocks. The experiment shows that reflecting the low-risk view in the market equilibrium portfolio improves profitability and that this view dominates the market portfolio.},

Hierarchical clustering refers to the formation of a recursive clustering, suggested by the data, not defined a priori. Several hierarchical clustering methods are presented and tested. Once the assets are hierarchically clustered, the authors compute a simple and efficient capital allocation within and across clusters of assets, so that many correlated assets receive the same total allocation as a single uncorrelated one. The out-of-sample performances of hierarchical clustering-based portfolios and more traditional risk-based portfolios are evaluated across three disparate datasets, which differ in term of the number of assets and the assets' composition. To avoid data snooping, the authors assess the comparison of profit measures using the bootstrap-based model confidence set procedure. Their empirical results indicate that hierarchical clustering-based portfolios are robust and truly diversified and achieve statistically better risk-adjusted performances than commonly used portfolio optimization techniques.},

Most funds are unable to outperform the market systematically, although a few are able to exploit relatively inefficient markets. Top performing funds are characterised by a better management of downside risk in times of market distress, whilst simultaneously exploiting learning effects when markets return to equilibrium. By conditioning fund performance on the state of the underlying market, we propose a conditional alpha ratio, which helps to better understand fund performance and can improve the fund selection process for investors.},

Various machine learning methods including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep neural network are applied. Utilizing the predictive power of advanced machine learning methods, a set of predictive features are derived from historical returns. The return-based information set effectively captures the underlying association between the historical information of hedge funds and their future returns; and is shown to be an effective addition to macroeconomic factors in predicting hedge fund returns. The empirical results demonstrate the remarkable advantages of the machine learning approach in the out-of-sample performance compared to the benchmarks. A close investigation into the causes for such improvement reveals that the notable gain in returns come from two sources: a paradigm shift from time series regression to cross-sectional regression and the employment of the advanced modeling techniques. Among the advanced machine learning methods, the deep neural network is overall most effective. The kurtosis of returns is shown to be most important among the return-based features and is even more predictive than some macroeconomic factors for the machine learning methods. A bootstrap analysis validates that the superior performance is not due to "pure luck". Furthermore, a series of robustness tests illustrate that the proposed machine learning approach is persistent to some extent and is robust in both bull and bear markets.},

  abstract       = {Stock trading strategy plays a crucial role in investment companies. However, it is challenging to obtain optimal strategy in the complex and dynamic stock market. We explore the potential of deep reinforcement learning to optimize stock trading strategy and thus maximize investment return. 30 stocks are selected as our trading stocks and their daily prices are used as the training and trading market environment. We train a deep reinforcement learning agent and obtain an adaptive trading strategy. The agent's performance is evaluated and compared with Dow Jones Industrial Average and the traditional min-variance portfolio allocation strategy. The proposed deep reinforcement learning approach is shown to outperform the two baselines in terms of both the Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns.},

Automating this process with machine learning remains a challenging problem. Here, we design a deep reinforcement learning (RL) architecture with an autonomous trading agent such that, investment decisions and actions are made periodically, based on a global objective, with autonomy. In particular, without relying on a purely model-free RL agent, we train our trading agent using a novel RL architecture consisting of an infused prediction module (IPM), a generative adversarial data augmentation module (DAM) and a behavior cloning module (BCM). Our model-based approach works with both on-policy or off-policy RL algorithms. We further design the back-testing and execution engine which interact with the RL agent in real time. Using historical { real} financial market data, we simulate trading with practical constraints, and demonstrate that our proposed model is robust, profitable and risk-sensitive, as compared to baseline trading strategies and model-free RL agents from prior work.},

While predicting the future return distributions always represents the most compelling challenge in investment, any underlying distribution can be always well approximated by utilizing a mixture distribution, if we are able to ensure that the component list of a mixture distribution includes all possible distributions corresponding to the scenario analysis of potential market modes.

Adopting a mixture distribution enables us to

(1) reduce the problem of distribution prediction to a parameter estimation problem in which the mixture weights of a mixture distribution are estimated under a Bayesian learning scheme and the corresponding credible regions of the mixture weights are obtained as well

(2) harmonize information from different channels, such as historical data, market implied information and investors subjective views.

We further formulate a robust mean-CVaR portfolio selection problem to deal with the inherent uncertainty in predicting the future return distributions. By employing the duality theory, we show that the robust portfolio selection problem via learning with a mixture model can be reformulated as a linear program or a second-order cone program, which can be effectively solved in polynomial time.

We present the results of simulation analyses and primary empirical tests to illustrate a significance of the proposed approach and demonstrate its pros and cons.},

  abstract       = {Although several models have been proposed towards assisting machine learning (ML) tasks with quantum computers, a direct comparison of the expressive power and efficiency of classical versus quantum models for datasets originating from real-world applications is one of the key milestones towards a quantum ready era. Here, we take a first step towards addressing this challenge by performing a comparison of the widely used classical ML models known as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), against a recently proposed quantum model, now known as quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs). Both models address the same hard tasks in unsupervised generative modeling, with QCBMs exploiting the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and a candidate for near-term quantum computers, as experimentally demonstrated in three different quantum hardware architectures to date. To address the question of the performance of the quantum model on real-world classical data sets, we construct scenarios from a probabilistic version out of the well-known portfolio optimization problem in finance, by using time-series pricing data from asset subsets of the S\&P500 stock market index. It is remarkable to find that, under the same number of resources in terms of parameters for both classical and quantum models, the quantum models seem to have superior performance on typical instances when compared with the canonical training of the RBMs. Our simulations are grounded on a hardware efficient realization of the QCBMs on ion-trap quantum computers, by using their native gate sets, and therefore readily implementable in near-term quantum devices.},

Persistence risk is positive during recessions and negative during expansions. This asymmetry, which solely results from learning about persistence, causes expected returns, return volatility, and the price of risk to rise during recessions. Persistence risk predicts future excess returns, particularly at 3- to 7-year horizons. Its predictability is strongest around business-cycle peaks and troughs.

However, in practice, the decision process does not follow that theory since the qualitative aspect coming from human decision making process is missing. Further, a large number of studies in empirical finance showed that financial assets exhibit trends or cycles, resulting in persistent inefficiencies in the market, that can be exploited. The uneven assimilation of information emphasised the multifractal nature of the capital markets, recognising complexity. New theories to explain financial markets developed, among which is a multitude of interacting agents forming a complex system characterised by a high level of uncertainty. Recently, with the increased availability of data, econophysics emerged as a mix of physical sciences and economics to get the best of both world, in view of analysing more deeply assets' predictability. For instance, data mining and machine learning methodologies provide a range of general techniques for classification, prediction, and optimisation of structured and unstructured data. Using these techniques, one can describe financial markets through degrees of freedom which may be both qualitative and quantitative in nature. In this book we detail how the growing use of quantitative methods changed finance and investment theory. The most significant benefit being the power of automation, enforcing a systematic investment approach and a structured and unified framework. We present in a chronological order the necessary steps to identify trading signals, build quantitative strategies, assess expected returns, measure and score strategies, and allocate portfolios.},

Previous research reports numerous ways to measure momentum and establishes a multitude of factors predicting its performance. The emerging machine learning asset pricing literature further identifies price-based firm characteristics as major predictors of returns. I investigate predictive power of a broad set of price-based variables over various time horizons in a deep learning framework and document rich non-linear structure in impact of these variables on expected returns in the US equity market. The magnitude and sign of the impact exhibit substantial time variation and are modulated by interaction effects among the variables. The degree of non-linearity in expected returns varies over time and is highest in distressed markets. Incorporating insights from the literature on time-varying, market state-dependent momentum risks and momentum crashes helps to improve out-of-sample performance of neural network portfolios, especially with respect to the downside risk -- investment strategies built on predictions of the deep learning model actively exploit the non-linearities and interaction effects, generating high and statistically significant returns with a robust risk profile and their performance virtually uncorrelated with the established risk factors including momentum. Lastly, I make a case for adoption of automated hyperparameter optimization techniques as an important component of disciplined research in financial machine learning.},

We take dropout as a Bayesian approximation to obtain prediction uncertainty and show it often deviates significantly from other measures of uncertainty such as volatility. We propose two very different ways of portfolio construction - one based on expected returns and uncertainty and the other which obtains allocations as part of the neural network and optimizes a custom utility function such as portfolio sharpe. We also find that adding a layer of error correction helps reduce drawdown significantly during the 2008 financial crisis. Finally, we compare results to risk parity and show that the above deep learning strategies trained in totally walk-forward manner have comparable performance.},

Our crucial innovation is the use of the no-arbitrage condition as part of the neural network algorithm. We estimate the stochastic discount factor (SDF or pricing kernel) that explains all asset prices from the conditional moment constraints implied by no-arbitrage. For this purpose, we combine three different deep neural network structures in a novel way: A feedforward network to capture non-linearities, a recurrent Long-Short-Term-Memory network to find a small set of economic state processes, and a generative adversarial network to identify the portfolio strategies with the most unexplained pricing information. Our model allows us to understand what are the key factors that drive asset prices, identify mis-pricing of stocks and generate the mean-variance efficient portfolio. Empirically, our approach outperforms out-of- sample all other benchmark approaches: Our optimal portfolio has an annual Sharpe Ratio of 2.1, we explain 8\% of the variation in individual stock returns and explain over 90\% of average returns for all anomaly sorted portfolios.},

  abstract             = {The portfolio optimization model has limited impact in practice because of estimation issues when applied to real data. To address this, we adapt two machine learning methods, regularization and cross-validation, for portfolio optimization. First, we introduce performance-based regularization (PBR), where the idea is to constrain the sample variances of the estimated portfolio risk and return, which steers the solution toward one associated with less estimation error in the performance. We consider PBR for both mean-variance and mean-conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) problems. For the mean-variance problem, PBR introduces a quartic polynomial constraint, for which we make two convex approximations: one based on rank-1 approximation and another based on a convex quadratic approximation. The rank-1 approximation PBR adds a bias to the optimal allocation, and the convex quadratic approximation PBR shrinks the sample covariance matrix. For the mean-CVaR problem, the PBR model is a combinatorial optimization problem, but we prove its convex relaxation, a quadratically constrained quadratic program, is essentially tight. We show that the PBR models can be cast as robust optimization problems with novel uncertainty sets and establish asymptotic optimality of both sample average approximation (SAA) and PBR solutions and the corresponding efficient frontiers. To calibrate the right-hand sides of the PBR constraints, we develop new, performance-based k-fold cross-validation algorithms. Using these algorithms, we carry out an extensive empirical investigation of PBR against SAA, as well as L1 and L2 regularizations and the equally weighted portfolio. We find that PBR dominates all other benchmarks for two out of three Fama-French data sets.},

A recursive numerical approach based on the Least Squares Monte Carlo method is used to calculate the conditional value functions of investors for a sequence of discrete decision dates. The methodology is data driven, is not restricted to specific asset models. Importantly, intermediate transaction costs associated with portfolio rebalancing is considered in the dynamic optimisation process. Investors' risk preferences and risk management constraints are also taken into account in the current implementation. A case study is presented for a global equity portfolio invested in five equity markets, and foreign exchange risks are also included. The case study provides a numerical example of using the methodology for 8-dimensions.},

A large amount of research in the area of stock performance prediction has already been done, and multiple existing results have shown that data derived from textual sources related to the stock market can be successfully used towards forecasting. These existing approaches have mostly focused on short term forecasting, used relatively simple sentiment analysis techniques, or had little data available. In this thesis, we prepare over ten years worth of stock data and propose a solution which combines features from textual yearly and quarterly filings with fundamental factors for long term stock performance forecasting. Additionally, we develop a method of text feature extraction and apply feature selection aided by a novel evaluation function. We work with investment company Highstreet Inc. and create a set of models with our technique allowing us to compare the performance to their own models. Our results show that feature selection is able to greatly improve the validation and test performance when compared to baseline models. We also show that for 2015, our method produces models which perform comparably to Highstreet's hand-made models while requiring no expert knowledge beyond data preparation, making the model an attractive aid for constructing investment portfolios. Highstreet has decided to continue to work with us on this research, and our machine learning models can potentially be used in actual portfolio selection in the near future.},

The authors extend an existing linear clones approach and introduce a new sequential oscillating selection method to produce a computationally efficient inference. Such techniques could inform efforts to detect fund window dressing of disclosure statements or to adjust market positions in advance of major fund disclosure dates. The authors test the approach by tasking the algorithm with inferring the constituents of exchange-traded funds for which the components can be later examined. Depending on the details of the specific problem, the algorithm runs on consumer hardware in 8 to 15 seconds and identifies target portfolio constituents with an accuracy of 88.2\% to 98.6\%.},

We connect our model to a robust portfolio selection problem, and investigate effects of the SGLasso regularization on the optimal strategy both theoretically and empirically. We develop an efficient algorithm to find the optimal portfolio and prove its global convergence.

For determining the amount for investing in the risky asset, a critical parameter is a constant risk multiplier that is calculated in our proposed model using RGP to reflect market dynamics. Our model includes four main steps: (1) Selecting the best stocks for constructing a portfolio using a density-based clustering strategy. (2) Enhancing the robustness of our proposed model with an application of the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) for forecasting the future prices of the selected stocks. The findings show that using ANFIS, instead of a regular multi-layer artificial neural network improves the prediction accuracy and our model robustness. (3) Implementing the RGP model for calculating the risk multiplier. Risk variables are used to generate equation trees for calculating the risk multiplier. (4) Determining the optimal portfolio weights of the assets using the well-known Markowitz portfolio optimization model. Experimental results show that our proposed strategy outperforms our previous model.},

Searching firm characteristic space over deep architectures of nonlinear transformations is compatible with the economic goal of eliminating mispricing Alphas. Joint estimation of factors and betas is achieved with stochastic gradient descent. To illustrate our methodology, we design long-short latent factors in a train-validation-testing framework of US stock market asset returns from 1975 to 2017.

One regime reflects the normal period where the asset price divided by the dividend is assumed to follow a mean-reverting process around a stochastic long run mean. The second regime reflects the bubble period with explosive behavior. Stochastic switches between two regimes and non-constant probabilities of exit from the bubble regime are both allowed. A Bayesian learning approach is employed to jointly estimate the latent states and the model parameters in real time. An important feature of our Bayesian method is that we are able to deal with parameter uncertainty and at the same time, to learn about the states and the parameters sequentially, allowing for real time model analysis. This feature is particularly useful for market surveillance. Analysis using simulated data reveals that our method has good power properties for detecting bubbles. Empirical analysis using price-dividend ratios of SandP500 highlights the advantages of our method.},

  abstract       = {The recent fast development of machine learning provides new tools to solve challenges in many areas. In finance, average options are popular financial products among corporations, institutional investors, and individual investors for risk management and investment because average options have the advantages of cheap prices and their payoffs are not very sensitive to the changes of the underlying asset prices at the maturity date, avoiding the manipulation of asset prices and option prices. The challenge is that pricing arithmetic average options requires traditional numerical methods with the drawbacks of expensive repetitive computations and simplified models with non-realistic assumptions. This paper proposes a machine-learning method to price arithmetic and geometric average options accurately and in particular quickly. We show the effectiveness of the new method by carrying out comprehensive numerical experiments. Finally, the method is verified by an empirical test. This empirical test actually shows that the machine learning method provides a new model-free method for asset pricing.},

For an infinite-horizon model with linear state dynamics and exogenous volatilities, the equilibrium returns mean-revert around their frictionless counterparts -- the deviation has Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics for quadratic costs whereas it follows a doubly-reflected Brownian motion if costs are proportional. More general models with arbitrary state dynamics and endogenous volatilities lead to multidimensional systems of nonlinear, fully-coupled forward-backward SDEs. These fall outside the scope of known wellposedness results, but can be solved numerically using the simulation-based deep-learning approach of han.al.17. In a calibration to time series of returns, bid-ask spreads, and trading volume, transaction costs substantially affect equilibrium asset prices. In contrast, the effects of different cost specifications are rather similar, justifying the use of quadratic costs as a proxy for other less tractable specifications.},

Our model retrofits the workhorse unsupervised dimension reduction device from the machine learning literature - autoencoder neural networks - to incorporate information from covariates along with returns themselves. This delivers estimates of nonlinear conditional exposures and the associated latent factors. Furthermore, our machine learning framework imposes the economic restriction of no-arbitrage. Our autoencoder asset pricing model delivers out-of-sample pricing errors that are far smaller (and generally insignificant) compared to other leading factor models.},

  abstract       = {We present a simple model of a non-equilibrium self-organizing market where asset prices are partially driven by investment decisions of a bounded-rational agent. The agent acts in a stochastic market environment driven by various exogenous "alpha" signals, agent's own actions (via market impact), and noise. Unlike traditional agent-based models, our agent aggregates all traders in the market, rather than being a representative agent. Therefore, it can be identified with a bounded-rational component of the market itself, providing a particular implementation of an Invisible Hand market mechanism. In such setting, market dynamics are modeled as a fictitious self-play of such bounded-rational market-agent in its adversarial stochastic environment. As rewards obtained by such self-playing market agent are not observed from market data, we formulate and solve a simple model of such market dynamics based on a neuroscience-inspired Bounded Rational Information Theoretic Inverse Reinforcement Learning (BRIT-IRL). This results in effective asset price dynamics with a non-linear mean reversion - which in our model is generated dynamically, rather than being postulated. We argue that our model can be used in a similar way to the Black-Litterman model. In particular, it represents, in a simple modeling framework, market views of common predictive signals, market impacts and implied optimal dynamic portfolio allocations, and can be used to assess values of private signals. Moreover, it allows one to quantify a "market-implied" optimal investment strategy, along with a measure of market rationality. Our approach is numerically light, and can be implemented using standard off-the-shelf software such as TensorFlow.},

The Bayesian Markowitz problem is then embedded into an auxiliary standard control problem that we characterize by a dynamic programming method and prove the existence and uniqueness of a smooth solution to the related semi-linear partial differential equation (PDE). The optimal Markowitz portfolio strategy is explicitly computed in the case of a Gaussian prior distribution. Finally, we measure the quantitative impact of learning, updating the strategy from observed data, compared to non-learning, using a constant drift in an uncertain context, and analyze the sensitivity of the value of information w.r.t. various relevant parameters of our model.},

As different as these approaches are, they typically appear to exhibit a satisfactory out-of-sample performance; however, at the same time, studies show that the equally weighted portfolio still cannot be dominated by them. The starting point of our study is therefore not an(other) entirely new idea, which is based on a new strategy we claim performs well, but instead the acknowledgement that the strategies proposed in earlier studies have specific advantages, which, though not consistently apparent, might prevail in specific and possible rare situations of dynamic markets. We therefore propose a strategy that "learns from"a population of already existing strategies and dynamically combines their respective characteristics, resulting in a strategy that is expected to perform best in light of the expected/predicted market situation. We show that our approach is successful by carrying out an empirical backtest study applied in a multi-asset setting for investor clienteles with mean-variance, mean-conditional value-at-risk, and maximum Omega utility functions. The improvements of our flexible approach, which include a higher mean return and lower volatility, stay (statistically) significant, even when we take into account transaction costs and improve the competing strategies by employing robust input parameter estimates.},

Our Bayesian inference for model selection identifies useful macro predictors (long-term yield, inflation, and stock market variance) and asset characteristics (dividend yield, accrual, and gross profit). Using the selected model for predicting sector evolution, an equally weighted long-short portfolio on winners over losers achieves a 46\% Sharpe ratio with a significant Jensen alpha.

Several new nonlinear methods have been proposed for last many years. But the question of their assessment is still open for the study. Dimensionality reduction is the vital problem in supervised and unsupervised learning. For high-dimensional data, computation becomes heavy if no pre-processing is done before supplying it to any of the classifiers. Because of the constraints like memory and speed, it is not suitable for certain practical applications. As per the method of attribute selection process, attribute sets are provided as an input to the classifier. The attributes that incorrectly classified are supposed to be irrelevant and are removed by obtaining the subset of selected attributes. Thus, accuracy of the classifier is improved, and time is also reduced. Attribute evaluators such as cfsSubset evaluator, information gain ranking filter, chi-squared ranking filter and gain ration feature evaluator are used for the classifiers viz. decision table, decision stump, J48, random forest. Individual investor investment portfolio data is used for the present study. Twenty-six attributes are obtained from the questionnaire. By applying dimensionality reduction techniques, five major attributes are obtained using information gain ranking filter, chi-squared ranking filter, gain ratio feature evaluation and seven attributes using cfsSubset evaluator. Around 70.7692\% accuracy is obtained using three attribute evaluators for all five classification algorithms, whereas cfsSubset evaluator along with random forest classifier gives 81.5385\% accuracy. It has been observed that cfsSubset evaluator with partition membership as a pre-processing technique and random forest as classification algorithm performs reasonably better in terms of accuracy.},

This paper aims to extract both sentiment and BoW information from the annual reports of US firms. The sentiment analysis is based on two commonly used dictionaries, namely a general dictionary Diction 7.0 and a finance-specific dictionary proposed by Loughran and McDonald (J Finance 66:35-65, 2011). The BoW are selected according to their tf-idf. We combine these features with financial indicators to predict abnormal stock returns using a multilayer perceptron neural network with dropout regularization and rectified linear units. We show that this method performs similarly as naive Bayes and outperforms other machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, C4.5 decision tree, and k-nearest neighbour classifier) in predicting positive/negative abnormal stock returns in terms of ROC. We also show that the quality of the prediction significantly increased when using the correlation-based feature selection of BoW. This prediction performance is robust to industry categorization and event window.},

  abstract       = {Practical Applications Summary Quantitative investing, which deploys machine learning and other algorithms, now more or less dominates financial markets. In this environment, it9s useful to step back and compare the performance and risk exposures of discretionary and systematic hedge fund managers. Many allocators to hedge funds, large and small alike, avoid allocating to systematic funds, either partially or entirely, believing them to be difficult to understand, to offer less transparency, and to deliver worse performance due to the use of data from the past. These reasons seem to be consistent with aversion distrust of systems. In their article Man vs. Machine: Comparing Discretionary and Systematic Hedge Fund Performance, published in the Summer 2017 issue of The Journal of Portfolio Management , Campbell R. Harvey, Sandy Rattray, Andrew Sinclair, and Otto van Hemert compare the past performance of systematic funds with their discretionary counterparts. They show that, after adjusting for volatility and factor exposures, the lack of confidence in systematic funds is not justified.},

This article describes how a method of Machine Learning, Kohonen Self-Organising Maps (SOM), can be applied to visualise risk and to build robust portfolios of hedge fund managers. Essentially, it documents a feasibility study that was conducted to gauge whether Machine Learning can add any value to the investment process of an investor in hedge funds.We suggest a simple method to exploit the SOM feature of identifying similarities in high-dimensional data: managers are selected from the 4 most remote parts of the SOM, i.e., the units in the lower left, lower right, upper left and upper right corners. Hedge Fund portfolios based on this method achieve more favourable risk/return ratios and lower drawdowns than benchmarks. In discussions with clients it has turned out that the way SOMs work as well as the method to pick managers from remote areas of the SOM can be intuitively explained and understood, which increases acceptance by practitioners.},

We investigate these by using regression that is based on the latest techniques from deep learning such as stacked autoencoders and denoising autoencoders. Empirical results indicate that our regression-based variations can generate increased returns, and improved higher-order moments and maximum drawdown characteristics.

Present-value identities, such as Campbell-Shiller or clean-surplus accounting, however, clearly predict that expected returns are highly non-linear functions of all characteristics. While basic non-linearities can be easily accommodated by adding non-linear functions to the set of characteristics, the problem quickly becomes infeasible once interactions of characteristics are considered. I propose a method which uses economically-driven regularization to construct a stochastic discount factor (SDF) when the set of characteristics is extended to an arbitrary - potentially infinitely-dimensional - set of non-linear functions of original characteristics. The method borrows ideas from a machine learning technique known as the trick to circumvent the curse of dimensionality. I find that allowing for interactions and non-linearities of characteristics leads to substantially more efficient SDFs; out-of-sample Sharpe ratios for the implied MVE portfolio double.},

The core idea of this study is to outline an automated framework for achieving a faster and easier parameter selection process, and at the same time, generating useful prediction uncertainty estimates in order to effectively tackle flexible real-world financial time series prediction problems. A Bayesian approach to SVR is discussed, and implemented. It is found that the direct implementation of the probabilistic framework of Gao et al. returns unsatisfactory results in our experiments. A novel enhancement is proposed by adding a new kernel scaling parameter to overcome the difficulties encountered. In addition, the multi-armed bandit Bayesian optimization technique is applied to automate the parameter selection process. Our framework is then tested on financial time series of various asset classes (i.e. equity index, credit default swaps spread, bond yields, and commodity futures) to ensure its flexibility. It is shown that the generalization performance of this parameter selection process can reach or sometimes surpass the computationally expensive cross-validation procedure. An adaptive calibration process is also described to allow practical use of the prediction uncertainty estimates to assess the quality of predictions. It is shown that the machine-learning approach discussed in this study can be developed as a very useful pricing tool, and potentially a market condition change detector. A further extension is possible by taking the prediction uncertainties into consideration when building a financial portfolio.},

For the sake of simplicity, we focus on predicting the direction (e.g. either up or down) of several liquid ETFs and do not attempt to predict the magnitude of price changes. The ETFs we use serve as asset class proxies. We employ approximately five years of historical daily data obtained through Yahoo Finance from January 2011 to January 2016. Utilizing our supervised learning classification algorithms, readily available from Python's Scikit-Learn, we employ three powerful techniques:

(1) Deep Neural Networks,

(2) Random Forests, and

(3) Support Vector Machines (linear and radial basis function).

We document the performance of our three algorithms across our four information sets. We segment our information sets into

(A) past returns,

(B) past volume,

(C) dummies for days/months, and a combination of all three.

We introduce our "gain criterion"to aid in our comparison of classifiers' performance. First, we find that these algorithms work well over the one-month to three-month horizons. Short-horizon predictability, over days, is extremely difficult, thus our results support the short-term random walk hypothesis. Second, we document the importance of cross-sectional and intertemporal volume as a powerful information set. Third, we show that many features are needed for predictability as each feature provides very small contributions. We conclude, therefore, that ETFs can be predicted with machine learning algorithms but practitioners should incorporate prior knowledge of markets and intuition on asset class behavior.},

  abstract       = {We propose a long-term forecast model based on linear growth and mean reversion characteristics in the U.S. stock market. It can forecast future returns of the stock market, Treasury yield, and gold price. The name comes from its optimal trend-following window of 45 years. The name comes from the hypothesis that there are fault lines in the historical CAPE, which can be calibrated and corrected through statistical learning. The tectonically adjusted log-CAPE can be fully decomposed by a four-factor regression: two from mean reversion, two from inflation. This regression explains the mystery of lofty CAPE. These five factors form the forecast model for the 10 and 20-year future equity returns with high R-square above 80\%. Major fault lines in CAPE are identified in each equity forecast model. We also analyze the causality in which the equity cycle leads both the Treasury yield and real gold price by 74 and 30 months. Therefore, their near-term direction can be predicted by extrapolating the regression. For longer horizon, we apply the factor model to forecast Treasury 20-year future yield and gold 20-year real return. A parsimonious triangular wave model is constructed to explain the periodicity of mean reversion in the past century. We conclude that the channel deviation is an universal mean-reversion variable among the three major asset classes.},

The framework consists of two parts: a forward pass in which we train the weights of the ANN off-line, valuing options under many different asset model parameter settings; and a backward pass, in which we evaluate the trained ANN-solver on-line, aiming to find the weights of the neurons in the input layer. The rapid on-line learning of implied volatility by ANNs, in combination with the use of an adapted parallel global optimization method, tackles the computation bottleneck and provides a fast and reliable technique for calibrating model parameters while avoiding, as much as possible, getting stuck in local minima.

With this additional input we compute the Hansen-Jagannathan distance to compare how alternative models fit the cross-section. We apply the method to 900 portfolio return series in the Kenneth French data library. While macro factors fail to explain most cross-sectional variation, we find that both consumption and inflation risk are priced.},

  abstract       = {Financial forecasting is challenging and attractive in machine learning. There are many classic solutions, as well as many deep learning based methods, proposed to deal with it yielding encouraging performance. Stock time series forecasting is the most representative problem in financial forecasting. Due to the strong connections among stocks, the information valuable for forecasting is not only included in individual stocks, but also included in the stocks related to them. However, most previous works focus on one single stock, which easily ignore the valuable information in others. To leverage more information, in this paper, we propose a jointly forecasting approach to process multiple time series of related stocks simultaneously, using multi-task learning framework. Compared to the previous works, we use multiple networks to forecast multiple related stocks, using the shared and private information of them simultaneously through multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose an attention method learning an optimized weighted combination of shared and private information based on the idea of Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to help forecast. Experimental results on various data show improved forecasting performance over baseline methods.},

I start by summarizing the evidence on cross-sectional return predictability and the failure of standard (consumption) capital asset pricing models (CAPMs) and their conditional versions to explain these predictability patterns. Part of the recent literature focuses on ad hoc factor models, which summarize the cross section of expected returns in parsimonious form, or on production-based approaches, which suggest links between firm characteristics and expected returns. Without imposing restrictions on investor preferences and beliefs, neither one of these two approaches can answer the question of why investors price assets the way they do. Within the rational expectations paradigm, recent research that imposes such restrictions has focused on the intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM), long-run risks models, as well as frictions and liquidity risk. Approaches based on investor sentiment have focused on the development of empirical proxies for sentiment and for the limits to arbitrage that allow sentiment to affect prices. Empirical work that considers learning and adaptation of investors has worked with out-of-sample tests of cross-sectional predictability.},

  abstract             = {We investigate the use of machine learning techniques into building statistically stable systematic allocation strategies. Traditionally, allocation processes usually rely on variations of Markowitz framework such as Mean Variance allocation, Maximum Diversity, Risk Parity, Conditional Value at Risk, ie convex frontier optimization. Although those methods show some efficiency to allocate assets through the convex efficient frontier, they usually rely deeply on the estimation and the usage of the covariance matrix. Being no stationary and having multiple range memory (ie FIGARCH), the statistical estimation of covariance may lead to biases and errors and in the end, bias conclusions. Very extensive literature in econo-metrics, econo-physics, quantitative allocation cover this problem in order to remedy to the statistical estimation of covariance and his bias and issues.Here, our emphasis is not a new estimator of the covariance matrix, or a variant of Risk Parity but an application of Machine Learning techniques to infer no-linear relationships and long range memory between the assets.It has the advantage to remove the linear projection of the assets onto the covariance framework and then capture no-linear relationships between at various time periods.Recent advances in Neural Network, Deep Learning and Machine Learning allows a more efficient modeling of the no-linear statistical relationships between data (ie price, dividends,....). Among them, we can mention Restricted Boltzman Machines, Variationnal Auto-encoders and variations of Recurrent Neural Network, Highway Long Short Term Memory Network as well as Factorization Machines for projection on local sub-spaces.Thus, we investigate some of the techniques to develop practical systematic allocation strategies by reducing risks and estimations biases and show the results.},

Like the traditional risk based allocation methods, HRP is also a function of the estimate of the covariance matrix, however, it doesn require its invertibility. In this paper we first study the impact of covariance misspecification on the performance of the different allocation methods. Next we study under appropriate covariance forecast model whether the machine learning based HRP out-performs the traditional risk based portfolios. For our analysis we use the test for superior predictive ability, on out-of-sample portfolio performance, to determine whether the observed excess performance is significant or occurred by chance. We find that when the covariance estimates are crude, inverse volatility weighted portfolios are more robust, followed by the machine learning based portfolios. Minimum variance and maximum diversification are most sensitive to covariance misspecification. HRP follows the middle ground, it is less sensitive to covariance misspecification when compared with minimum variance or maximum diversification portfolio, while it is not as robust as the inverse volatility weighed portfolio. We also study the impact of different rebalancing horizon and how the portfolios compare against a market-capitalization weighted portfolio.},

The authors show that SVM has excellent predictive performance for this task, capturing all six recessions from 1973 to 2018 and providing the signal with minimal delay. The authors take advantage of the timeliness of SVM signals to test dynamic asset allocation between stocks and bonds.

Cryptocurrencies are electronic and decentralized alternatives to government-issued money, with Bitcoin as the best-known example of a cryptocurrency. All three instances of the framework monopolize the top three positions in all experiments, outdistancing other compared trading algorithms. Although with a high commission rate of 0.25\% in the backtests, the framework is able to achieve at least 4-fold returns in 50 days.},

There are major contributions in this paper which include the introduction of an input selection criterion when utilizing an expansive universe of inputs, a hybrid combination of partial swarm optimizer (PSO) with radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, the application of a PSO algorithm to a traditional autoregressive moving model (ARMA), the application of a PSO algorithm to a higher-order neural network and, finally, the introduction of a multi-objective algorithm to optimize statistical and trading performance when trading an index. All the machine learning-based methodologies and the conventional models are adapted and optimized to model the index. A PSO algorithm is used to optimize the weights in a traditional RBF neural network, in a higher-order neural network (HONN) and the AR and MA terms of an ARMA model. In terms of checking the statistical and empirical accuracy of the novel models, we benchmark them with a traditional HONN, with an ARMA, with a moving average convergence/divergence model (MACD) and with a naive strategy. More specifically, the trading and statistical performance of all models is investigated in a forecast simulation of the FTSE 100 and DAX 30 ETF time series over the period January 2004 to December 2015 using the last 3 years for out-of-sample testing. Finally, the empirical and statistical results indicate that the PSO-RBF model outperforms all other examined models in terms of trading accuracy and profitability, even with mixed inputs and with only autoregressive inputs.},

Our approach is deeply rooted in Stochastic Portfolio Theory (SPT), a stochastic analysis framework introduced by Robert E. Fernholz that aims at flexibly analysing the performance of certain investment strategies in stock markets relative to benchmark indices. In particular, SPT has exhibited some investment strategies based on company sizes that, under realistic assumptions, outperform benchmark indices with probability 1 over certain time horizons. Galvanised by this result, we consider the inverse problem that consists of learning (from historical data) an optimal investment strategy based on any given set of trading characteristics, and using a user-specified optimality criterion that may go beyond outperforming a benchmark index. Although this inverse problem is of the utmost interest to investment management practitioners, it can hardly be tackled using the SPT framework. We show that our machine learning approach learns investment strategies that considerably outperform existing SPT strategies in the US stock market.},

  abstract       = {Stock prediction is always an attractive problem. With the expansion of information sources, news-driven stock prediction based on sentiments of social media, such as sentiment polarities in financial news, becomes more and more popular. However, the distributions of news articles among different stocks are skewed, which makes stocks with few news have few training samples for their prediction models, and thus leads to low prediction accuracy in the stock predictions. To address this problem, we propose sentimental transfer learning, which transfers sentimental information learned from news-rich stocks (source) to the news-poor ones (target), and prediction performances of the later ones are, therefore, improved. In this approach, the financial news articles of both the source and target stocks are first mapped into the same feature space that is constructed by sentiment dimensions. Second, we develop three different transfer principles in order to explore different transfer scenarios: 1) the source and target stocks historical price time series are highly correlated; 2) the source and target stocks are in the same sector and the former is the most news-rich one in the sector; and 3) the source stock has the highest prediction performance in validation data set. Third, a majority voting mechanism is designed based on the principles. The voting mechanism is to select the most proper source stock from the candidate stocks that are generated by different principles. Stock predictions are finally made based on the prediction models trained on the selected stocks. Experiments are conducted based on the data of Hong Kong Stock Exchange stocks from 2003 to 2008. The empirical results show that sentiment transfer learning can improve the prediction performance of the target stocks, and the performances are better and more stable with the source stocks selected by the voting mechanism.},

Four practical constraints, cardinality, quantity, pre-assignment and round lot, are considered. Performance wise, the proposed algorithm is not only capable to deliver high-quality portfolios enriched by additional constraints but also able to efficiently solve a reasonable size of asset up to 1318. It significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Portfolio optimization involves the optimal assignment of limited capital to different available financial assets to achieve a reasonable trade-off between profit and risk objectives. In this paper, we studied the extended Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio optimization model. We considered the cardinality, quantity, pre-assignment and round lot constraints in the extended model. These four real-world constraints limit the number of assets in a portfolio, restrict the minimum and maximum proportions of assets held in the portfolio, require some specific assets to be included in the portfolio and require to invest the assets in units of a certain size respectively. An efficient learning-guided hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the constrained portfolio optimization problem in the extended mean-variance framework. A learning-guided solution generation strategy is incorporated into the multi-objective optimization process to promote the efficient convergence by guiding the evolutionary search towards the promising regions of the search space. The proposed algorithm is compared against four existing state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA-2), Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm (PESA-II) and Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES). Computational results are reported for publicly available OR-library datasets from seven market indices involving up to 1318 assets.

In this work, we propose and investigate a new hybrid algorithm integrating the population based incremental learning and differential evolution algorithms for the portfolio selection problem. We consider the extended mean-variance model with practical trading constraints including the cardinality, floor and ceiling constraints. The proposed hybrid algorithm adopts a partially guided mutation and an elitist strategy to promote the quality of solution. The performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm has been evaluated on the extended benchmark datasets in the OR Library. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid algorithm is not only effective but also efficient in solving the mean-variance model with real world constraints.},

It has been widely accepted that public mood is correlated with financial markets. However, only a few studies discussed how the public mood would affect one of the fundamental problems of computational finance: portfolio management. In this study, we use public financial sentiment and historical prices collected from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to train multiple machine learning models for automatic wealth allocation across a set of assets. Unlike previous studies which set as target variable the asset prices in the portfolio, the variable to predict here is represented by the best asset allocation strategy ex post. Experiments performed on five portfolios show that long short-term memory networks are superior to multi-layer perceptron and random forests producing, in the period under analysis, an average increase in the revenue across the portfolios ranging between 5\% (without financial mood) and 19\% (with financial mood) compared to the equal-weighted portfolio. Results show that our all-in-one and end-to-end approach for automatic portfolio selection outperforms the equal-weighted portfolio. Moreover, when using long short-term memory networks, the employment of sentiment data in addition to lagged data leads to greater returns for all the five portfolios under evaluation. Finally, we find that among the employed machine learning algorithms, long short-term memory networks are better suited for learning the impact of public mood on financial time series.},

We find that a factor's most recent five-year performance is negatively correlated with its subsequent five-year performance.

By significantly extending the period of past performance used to forecast future performance, we can improve predictive ability, but the forecasts are still negatively correlated with subsequent performance: the forecast is still essentially useless!

Using relative valuations, we forecast the five-year expected alphas for a broad universe of smart beta strategies as a tool for managing expectations about current portfolios and constructing new portfolios positioned for future outperformance. These forecasts will be updated regularly and available on our website.

In a series of articles we published in 2016,1 we show that relative valuations predict subsequent returns for both factors and smart beta strategies in exactly the same way price matters in stock selection and asset allocation. To many, one surprising revelation in that series is that a number of "smart beta"strategies are expensive today relative to their historical valuations. The fact they are expensive has two uncomfortable implications. The first is that the past success of a smart beta strategy-often only a simulated past performance-is partly a consequence of "revaluation alpha"arising because many of these strategies enjoy a tailwind as they become more expensive. We, as investors, extrapolate that part of the historical alpha at our peril. The second implication is that any mean reversion toward the smart beta strategy's historical normal relative valuation could transform lofty historical alpha into negative future alpha. As with asset allocation and stock selection, relative valuations can predict the long-term future returns of strategies and factors-not precisely, nor with any meaningful short-term timing efficacy, but well enough to add material value. These findings are robust to variations in valuation metrics, geographies, and time periods used for estimation.},

First, the stock price time series is decomposed by WT to eliminate noise. Second, SAEs is applied to generate deep high-level features for predicting the stock price. Third, high-level denoising features are fed into LSTM to forecast the next day's closing price. Six market indices and their corresponding index futures are chosen to examine the performance of the proposed model.

As the training/validation split is independent of the number of folds, the algorithm offers more flexibility in the size, and number of training samples compared to kk-fold cross-validation. The study also provides for crogging and bagging: (1) the first systematic evaluation across time series length and combination size, (2) a bias and variance decomposition of the forecast errors to understand improvement gains, and (3) a comparison to established benchmarks of model averaging and selection. Crogging can easily be extended to other autoregressive models.

The interpretability of the generated models and a mathematically sound building procedure are two very important properties of forecasting models. The model fitting procedure employed by the original NCSTAR is a combination of initial parameter estimation by a grid search procedure with a traditional local search algorithm. We propose a different fitting procedure, using a memetic algorithm, in order to obtain more accurate models. An empirical evaluation of the method is performed, applying it to various real-world time series originating from three forecasting competitions.

However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often replaced by practitioners in favour of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. It is shown that for purely autoregressive models, the use of standard K fold CV is possible provided the models considered have uncorrelated errors. Such a setup occurs, for example, when the models nest a more appropriate model. This is very common when Machine Learning methods are used for prediction, and where CV can control for overfitting the data. Theoretical insights supporting these arguments are presented, along with a simulation study and a real-world example. It is shown empirically that K fold CV performs favourably compared to both OOS evaluation and other time-series-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation.},

We show that the information cascade from low- to high-frequency levels allows to identify long-lasting effects on expected returns that cannot be captured by standard persistent ARMA processes.

  abstract             = {We propose a Bayesian combination approach for multivariate predictive densities which relies upon a distributional state space representation of the combination weights. Several specifications of multivariate time-varying weights are introduced with a particular focus on weight dynamics driven by the past performance of the predictive densities and the use of learning mechanisms. In the proposed approach the model set can be incomplete, meaning that all models can be individually misspecified. A Sequential Monte Carlo method is proposed to approximate the filtering and predictive densities. The combination approach is assessed using statistical and utility-based performance measures for evaluating density forecasts of simulated data, US macroeconomic time series and surveys of stock market prices. Simulation results indicate that, for a set of linear autoregressive models, the combination strategy is successful in selecting, with probability close to one, the true model when the model set is complete and it is able to detect parameter instability when the model set includes the true model that has generated subsamples of data. Also, substantial uncertainty appears in the weights when predictors are similar; residual uncertainty reduces when the model set is complete; and learning reduces this uncertainty. For the macro series we find that incompleteness of the models is relatively large in the 1970's, the beginning of the 1980's and during the recent financial crisis, and lower during the Great Moderation; the predicted probabilities of recession accurately compare with the NBER business cycle dating; model weights have substantial uncertainty attached. With respect to returns of the SandP 500 series, we find that an investment strategy using a combination of predictions from professional forecasters and from a white noise model puts more weight on the white noise model in the beginning of the 1990's and switches to giving more weight to the professional forecasts over time. Information on the complete predictive distribution and not just on some moments turns out to be very important, above all during turbulent times such as the recent financial crisis. More generally, the proposed distributional state space representation offers great flexibility in combining densities.},

The task is particularly challenging due to the sparseness of the data samples and the complex interactions amongst the variables. At the same time, it is of high significance because of the important and paradigmatic role played by the US market in the world economy. Four data-driven artificial intelligence approaches are considered: a manually built fuzzy logic model, a machine learned fuzzy logic model, a self-organising map model, and a multi-layer perceptron model. Their prediction accuracy is compared with that of two classical approaches: a statistical ARIMA model and an econometric error correction model. The algorithms are evaluated on a complete series of end-month US 10-year Treasury bonds yields and economic indicators from 1986:1 to 2004:12. In terms of prediction accuracy and reliability, the best results are obtained by the three parametric regression algorithms, namely the econometric, the statistical, and the multi-layer perceptron model. Due to the sparseness of the learning data samples, the manual and the automatic fuzzy logic approaches fail to follow with adequate precision the range of variations of the US 10-year Treasury bonds. For similar reasons, the self-organising map model performs unsatisfactorily. Analysis of the results indicates that the econometric model has a slight edge over the statistical and the multi-layer perceptron models. This suggests that pure data-driven induction may not fully capture the complicated mechanisms ruling the changes in interest rates. Overall, the prediction accuracy of the best models is only marginally better than the prediction accuracy of a basic one-step lag predictor. This result highlights the difficulty of the modelling task and, in general, the difficulty of building reliable predictors for financial markets.},

State-of-the-art methods track the loss of the available models and adapt their weights accordingly. Metalearning strategies such as stacking are also used in these tasks. We propose a metalearning approach for adaptively combining forecasting models that specializes them across the time series. Our assumption is that different forecasting models have different areas of expertise and a varying relative performance. Moreover, many time series show recurring structures due to factors such as seasonality. Therefore, the ability of a method to deal with changes in relative performance of models as well as recurrent changes in the data distribution can be very useful in dynamic environments. Our approach is based on an ensemble of heterogeneous forecasters, arbitrated by a metalearning model. This strategy is designed to cope with the different dynamics of time series and quickly adapt the ensemble to regime changes. We validate our proposal using time series from several real world domains. Empirical results show the competitiveness of the method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches for combining forecasters.},

To address such concerns, various deep learning models, mainly Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based methods, are proposed. Nevertheless, capturing extremely long-term patterns while effectively incorporating information from other variables remains a challenge for time-series forecasting. Furthermore, lack-of-explainability remains one serious drawback for deep neural network models. Inspired by Memory Network proposed for solving the question-answering task, we propose a deep learning based model named Memory Time-series network (MTNet) for time series forecasting. MTNet consists of a large memory component, three separate encoders, and an autoregressive component to train jointly. Additionally, the attention mechanism designed enable MTNet to be highly interpretable. We can easily tell which part of the historic data is referenced the most.},

Time series data from complex systems capture the dynamic behaviors and causalities of the underlying processes and provide a tractable means to predict and monitor system state evolution. However, the nonlinear and non-stationary dynamics of the underlying processes pose a major challenge for accurate forecasting.

For most real-world systems, the vector field of state dynamics is a nonlinear function of the state variables; i.e., the relationship connecting intrinsic state variables with their autoregressive terms and exogenous variables is nonlinear. Time series emerging from such complex systems exhibit aperiodic (chaotic) patterns even under steady state. Also, since real-world systems often evolve under transient conditions, the signals obtained therefrom tend to exhibit myriad forms of non-stationarity. Nonetheless, methods reported in the literature focus mostly on forecasting linear and stationary processes.

This article presents a review of these advancements in nonlinear and non-stationary time series forecasting models and a comparison of their performances in certain real-world manufacturing and health informatics applications. Conventional approaches do not adequately capture the system evolution (from the standpoint of forecasting accuracy, computational effort, and sensitivity to quantity and quality of a priori information) in these applications.},

Fitting and/or simulating the intertemporal distribution of recurrence intervals is very much system specific. Study of recurrences in earthquakes, climate, financial time-series, etc. is crucial to better forecast disasters and limit their consequences. Most of the previous phenomenological studies of recurrences have involved only a long-ranged autocorrelation function, and ignored the multi-scaling properties induced by potential higher order dependencies. We argue that copulas is a natural model-free framework to study non-linear dependencies in time series and related concepts like recurrences. Consequently, we arrive at the facts that (i) non-linear dependences do impact both the statistics and dynamics of recurrence times, and (ii) the scaling arguments for the unconditional distribution may not be applicable. Hence, fitting and/or simulating the intertemporal distribution of recurrence intervals is very much system specific, and cannot actually benefit from universal features, in contrast to the previous claims. This has important implications in epilepsy prognosis and financial risk management applications.},

The general multivariate model, which can be formulated as a seemingly unrelated regression model, includes the previously studied homogeneous multivariate Holt-Winters' model as a special case when all of the univariate series share a common structure.

MCMC simulation techniques are required in order to approach the non-analytically tractable posterior distribution of the model parameters. The predictive distribution is then estimated using Monte Carlo integration. A Bayesian model selection criterion is introduced into the forecasting scheme for selecting the most adequate multivariate model for describing the behaviour of the time series under study.

The forecasting performance of this procedure is tested using some real examples.},

At the same time, statistical tests have recently been put forward in the literature in order to optimally determine the number of significant factors. In this article, we propose to reconcile both fields of interest by selecting the number of factors, through a testing procedure, to include in the forecasting equation. Through an empirical exercise on French and German GDPs, we assess the impact of a battery of recent statistical tests for the number of factors for a forecasting purpose. By implementing a rolling experience, we also assess the stability of the results overtime.},

However, in the context of many models of financial risk, interest centers on more than just a single point of the forecast distribution. For example, value-at-risk models that are currently in extremely wide use form interval forecasts. Many other important financial calculations also involve estimates not summarized by a point forecast. Although some techniques are currently available for assessing interval and density forecasts, existing methods tend to display low power in sample sizes typically available.

This article suggests a new approach to evaluating such forecasts. It requires evaluation of the entire forecast distribution, rather than a scalar or interval. The information content of forecast distributions combined with ex post realizations is enough to construct a powerful test even with sample sizes as small as 100.},

Our approach has superior out-of-sample predictive performance compared to the historical mean, from a statistical and economic perspective. We also find that our model statistically dominates its nested combination methods, including equal weighted models, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and Dynamic model averaging (DMA). By decomposing sources of prediction uncertainty into five parts, we uncover that our fully flexible approach more precisely identifies the time-variation in coefficients and the combination method we should apply, leading to mitigation of estimation risk and forecasting improvements.

The outlier problem is expected to pose similar difficulties for multivariate nonlinearity tests.

A Monte Carlo experiment is carried out to compare the power of the proposed test with that of the least squares-based test under the influence of additive time series outliers. The results indicate that the proposed method is preferable to the classical test when observations are contaminated by outliers.

We investigate whether stock returns of international markets are predictable from a range of fundamentals including key financial ratios (dividend-price ratio, dividend-yield, earnings-price ratio, dividend-payout ratio), technical indicators (price pressure, change in volume), and short-term interest rates. We adopt two new alternative testing and estimation methods: the improved augmented regression method and wild bootstrapping of predictive model based on a restricted VAR form. Both methods take explicit account of endogeneity of predictors, providing bias-reduced estimation and improved statistical inference in small samples. From monthly data of 16 Asia-Pacific (including U.S.) and 21 European stock markets from 2000 to 2014, we find that the financial ratios show weak predictive ability with small effect sizes and poor out-of-sample forecasting performances.

We assess the accuracy of the models using several measures of unbiasedness and predictive accuracy, and using Diebold and Mariano's approach to test whether differences in expected losses from all possible pairs of forecast models are statistically significant. We fail to find evidence that complex statistical models are uniformly more accurate than a naive constant expected return model for factor-mimicking portfolio (excess) returns. However, we show that it is possible to build simple portfolio strategies that profit from the higher out-of-sample predictive accuracy of forecasting models with Markov switching in conditional mean coefficients.

In sample, we consistently find a significant but limited contribution of leverage effects over the past 25 years of SandP 500 returns. From an out-of-sample forecasting perspective and using a variety of different models, we find no statistical or economical value in using leverage effects, provided that an asymmetric and fat-tailed conditional distribution is used. This conclusion holds both at the index level and for 70\% of the individual stocks constituents of the equity index.},

The risk measure forecast can take the form of a VaR, an Expected Shortfall, or a distribution forecast. The backtesting methods surveyed in this chapter can be seen as a final diagnostic check on the aggregate risk model carried out by the risk management team that constructed the risk model, or they can be used by external model-evaluators such as bank supervisors. Common for the approaches suggested is that they only require information on the daily ex ante risk model forecast and the daily ex post corresponding profit and loss. In particular, knowledge about the assumptions behind the risk model and its construction is not required.},

More frequent rebalancing uses statistically and economically significant short-horizon return predictability to aggressively pursue the dynamic investment opportunities afforded by changes in expected returns. However, the degree of return predictability typically appears stronger at longer horizons, which, along with lower transaction costs, favors less frequent rebalancing.

The authors analyze the performance effects of rebalancing frequency in the context of dynamic portfolios constructed from monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual return forecasts for U.S. stocks, bonds, and bills, where the dynamic portfolios rebalance at the same frequency as the forecast horizon. Along the transaction-cost/rebalancing frontier, monthly (annual) rebalancing provides the greatest outperformance when unit transaction costs are below (above) approximately 50 basis points, and dynamic portfolios based on annual rebalancing typically outperform the benchmarks for unit transaction costs well in excess of 400 basis points.},

A present value model that matches the data shows that discount rate and short rate movements play a large role in explaining the variation in dividend yields. Finally, we find that earnings yields significantly predict future cash flows. (JEL C12, C51, C52, E49, F30, G12)},

We consider two cases: where the agent's information set only includes the past of the return series, and where this set includes past values of relevant economic series, such as interest rates, commodities prices or exchange rates. Even though these procedures seem to be of no much use for predicting returns, it appears that there is real potential for some of these procedures, especially support vector machines, to improve over the standard GARCH(1,1) model the out-of-sample forecasting ability for squared returns. The researcher has to be cautious on the number of predictors employed and on the specific implementation of the procedures since using many predictors and the default settings of standard computing packages leads to overfitted models and to larger standard errors.},

Unfortunately, the insights gained in these studies are limited because they (i) present conflicting evidence on the time-varying nature of the estimated Hurst coefficients and (ii) incorrectly equate random walk behaviour with market efficiency. In this note, we revisit the issue of time-varying predictability for a rich sample of 21 emerging markets in the 27-year period from 1988 to 2015. Extending the two aforementioned studies by various alternative fractal estimators of the Hurst coefficient, trend regressions and several robustness checks, our analysis reveals significant downward trends in the local Hurst coefficients of almost all markets. Specifically, we document vanishing predictability over time, which indicates that profitable emerging market investment strategies based on past returns may not continue their good performance in the future. Furthermore, we explicitly point out why a random walk is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for rationally determined security prices, and thus signs of predictability (randomness) should not be interpreted as evidence for market inefficiency (efficiency).},

The second step estimates an error-correction equation, for modeling the expected returns. This approach is a factor model analysis, where a Lasso derived technique is used for variable selection. This paper will focus on the five most frequently traded Latin American currencies, Brazilian Real (BRL), Chilean Peso (CLP), Colombian Peso (COL), Mexican Peso (MXN) and Peruvian Sol (PEN), during the time horizon from December 2001 until February 2016. The first finding is that the Global Exchange Rate Factor offers information about the exchange rate movements. In addition, this paper shows that commodity, equity prices and domestic risk premium are important variables for explaining exchange rates. Moreover, it confirms the existing results for the carry and slope variables.},

We implement two novel methodologies, namely quantile-on-quantile analysis and cross-quantilogram to account for tail dependence and spillovers across quantile ranges. We find evidence of statistically significant spillover effects from extreme equity market returns and their corresponding volatility to specific stages of business cycles. The sensitivity of returns and volatility to business cycle shocks is only evident for extreme quantiles. These findings indicate the importance of modeling the nonlinearity and tail behaviour when analyzing the relationships between equity markets and business cycles. Financial and monetary policy regulators may use the dynamics of spillover predictability and influence between the equity market returns, their volatility and business cycles to exert some degree of control upon business cycle formation and development.},

In fact, REIT returns would display regime shifts that are more abrupt and persistent than in the case of other asset classes. In this paper we ask whether and how simple linear predictability models of the vector autoregressive (VAR) type may be extended to capture the bull and bear patterns typical of many asset classes, including REITs. We find that nonlinearities are so deep that it is impossibile for a large family of VAR models to either produce similar portfolio weights or to yield realized, ex-post out-of-sample long-horizon portfolio performances that may compete with those typical of bull and bear models. A typical investor with intermediate risk aversion and a 5-year horizon ought to be ready to pay an annual fee of up to 5.7 percent to have access to forecasts of REIT returns that take their bull and bear dynamics into account instead of simpler, linear forecast.},

For the persistence levels of dividend yields, the analytical correlation is 99 percent between the 1- and 2-year horizon estimators and 94 percent between the 1- and 5-year horizons. Common sampling error across equations leads to ordinary least squares coefficient estimates and R2s that are roughly proportional to the horizon under the null hypothesis. This is the precise pattern found in the data. We perform joint tests across horizons for a variety of explanatory variables and provide an alternative view of the existing evidence.},

We compare our variable with the most popular predictors in a sample period that includes the recent financial crisis. Our results suggest that oil price changes are the only variable with forecasting power for stock returns. This significant predictive ability is robust against the inclusion of other variables and out-of-sample tests. We also study the cross-section of expected stock returns in a conditional CAPM framework based on oil price shocks

We assess the accuracy of the models using several measures of unbiasedness and predictive accuracy, and, using Diebold and Mariano's approach to test whether differences in expected losses from all possible pairs of forecast models are statistically significant. We fail to find evidence that complex statistical models are uniformly more accurate than a naive constant expected return model for factor-mimicking portfolio (excess) returns. However, we show that it is possible to build simple portfolio strategies that profit from the higher out-of-sample predictive accuracy of forecasting models with Markov switching in conditional mean coefficients.

I find that the absence of dividend growth predictability gives stronger evidence than does the presence of return predictability. Long-horizon return forecasts give the same strong evidence. These tests exploit the negative correlation of return forecasts with dividend-yield autocorrelation across samples, together with sensible upper bounds on dividend-yield autocorrelation, to deliver more powerful statistics. I reconcile my findings with the literature that finds poor power in long-horizon return forecasts, and with the literature that notes the poor out-of-sample R2 of return-forecasting regressions.},

This thesis uses deep learning algorithms to forecast financial data. The deep learning framework is used to train a neural network. The deep neural network is a DBN coupled to a MLP. It is used to choose stocks to form portfolios. The portfolios have better returns than the median of the stocks forming the list. The stocks forming the SandP 500 are included in the study. The results obtained from the deep neural network are compared to bench- marks from a logistic regression network, a multilayer perceptron and a naive benchmark. The results obtained from the deep neural network are better and more stable than the benchmarks. The findings support that deep learning methods will find their way in finance due to their reliability and good performance.},

  abstract       = {On one hand, financial time series are multifractal, thus exhibiting non-Gaussian distribution, the presence of extreme values (outliers), and long-range dependent dynamics. On the other hand, machine learning (ML) models are processes relying heavily on statistical models and methodologies, but treated as black box models due to their inability to explicitly know the relations established between explanatory variables (input) and dependent variables (output). However, when forecasting market returns, or generating autonomous patterns, it is crucial to know the statistical properties of the time series produced by the ML model under consideration. Taking into consideration these statistical characteristics, we present a recipe using technical indicators to forecast both market returns and their directions. We choose to reverse the causality and propose a solution consisting in deciding upon the framework by defining how the model should be specified before beginning to analyse the actual data. We should define the framework by properly formulating model hypotheses which make financial or economic sense, and then carefully determining the number of dependent variables in a regression model, or the number of factors and components in a stochastic model.},

We therefore propose a new approach that combines the bagging, exponential smoothing and clustering methods. The existing methods use bagging to generate and aggregate groups of forecasts in order to reduce the variance. However, none of them consider the effect of covariance among the group of forecasts, even though it could have a dramatic impact on the variance of the group, and therefore on the forecast accuracy. The proposed approach, referred to here as Bagged Cluster ETS, aims to reduce the covariance effect by using partitioning around medoids (PAM) to produce clusters of similar forecasts, then selecting several forecasts from each cluster to create a group with a reduced variance. This approach was tested on various different time series sets from the M3 and CIF 2016 competitions. The empirical results have shown a substantial reduction in the forecast error, considering sMAPE and MASE.},

These architectures have reached relevant theoretical and practical results. However, in the learning process of complex time series using these hybrid systems two open questions arise: it is hard to ensure that the linear and nonlinear patterns, underlying the time series, are properly modeled; and the best function to combine the time series forecaster and error series forecaster is unknown. In this context, this work proposes a Nonlinear Combination (NoLiC) method to combine forecasters. The NoLiC method is a hybrid system that is composed of two steps: i) estimation of the models' parameters for the time series and their respective residuals, and ii) search for the best function that combines these models using a multi-layer perceptron. Experimental simulations are conducted using four real-world complex time series of great importance for public health and evaluated using six performance measures. The results show that the NoLiC method reaches superior results when compared with literature works.},

However, these models have not sufficiently discussed in data preparation to overcome randomness, as well as uncertainty and volatility of stock prices issues in achieving high forecasting accuracy. Therefore, the focus of this paper is the data preparation procedure of triangular fuzzy number to build an improved fuzzy random auto-regression model using non-stationary stock market data for forecasting purposes. The improved forecasting model considers two types of input, which are data with low-high and single point values of stock market prices. Even though, low-high data present variability and volatility in nature, the single data has to be form in symmetry left-right spread to present variability and standard error. Then, expectations and variances, confidence-intervals of fuzzy random data are constructed for fuzzy input-output data. By using the input-output data and simplex approach, parameters of the model can be estimated. In this study, some real data sets were used to represent both types of inputs, which are the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange and Alabama University enrollment. The study found that variability and spread adjustment are important factors in data preparation to improve accuracy of the fuzzy random auto-regression model.},

In addition, we introduce an online to batch algorithm and discrepancy measure to inform readers the newest research in time series predicting method, which doesn't require any stationarity or non mixing assumptions in time series data.

We extend the kernel ridge regression methodology to enable its use for economic time series forecasting, by including lags of the dependent variable or other individual variables as predictors, as is typically desired in macroeconomic and financial applications. Both Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to various key measures of real economic activity confirm that kernel ridge regression can produce more accurate forecasts than traditional linear and nonlinear methods for dealing with many predictors based on principal components.},

  abstract             = {We consider forecasting a single time series when there is a large number of predictors and a possible nonlinear effect. The dimensionality was first reduced via a high-dimensional (approximate) factor model implemented by the principal component analysis. Using the extracted factors, we develop a novel forecasting method called the sufficient forecasting, which provides a set of sufficient predictive indices, inferred from high-dimensional predictors, to deliver additional predictive power. The projected principal component analysis will be employed to enhance the accuracy of inferred factors when a semi-parametric (approximate) factor model is assumed. Our method is also applicable to cross-sectional sufficient regression using extracted factors. The connection between the sufficient forecasting and the deep learning architecture is explicitly stated. The sufficient forecasting correctly estimates projection indices of the underlying factors even in the presence of a nonparametric forecasting function. The proposed method extends the sufficient dimension reduction to high-dimensional regimes by condensing the cross-sectional information through factor models. We derive asymptotic properties for the estimate of the central subspace spanned by these projection directions as well as the estimates of the sufficient predictive indices. We further show that the natural method of running multiple regression of target on estimated factors yields a linear estimate that actually falls into this central subspace. Our method and theory allow the number of predictors to be larger than the number of observations. We finally demonstrate that the sufficient forecasting improves upon the linear forecasting in both simulation studies and an empirical study of forecasting macroeconomic variables.},

The performance of the SOP method comes mainly from the dividend-price ratio and earnings growth components, and the robustness of the method is due to its low estimation error.

In this way it has been usual to suppose that each single model generates a residual or prediction error like a white noise. However, mostly because of disturbances not captured by each model, it is yet possible that such supposition is violated. The present paper introduces a two-step method for correcting and combining forecasting models. Firstly, the stochastic process underlying the bias of each predictive model is built according to a recursive ARIMA algorithm in order to achieve a white noise behavior. At each iteration of the algorithm the best ARIMA adjustment is determined according to a given information criterion (e.g. Akaike). Then, in the light of the corrected predictions, it is considered a maximum likelihood combined estimator. Applications involving single ARIMA and artificial neural networks models for Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, SandP 500 Index, Google Stock Value, and Nasdaq Index series illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework.},

  title                = {Bootstrap forecasts of multivariate time series},
  abstract             = {In this thesis we study the performance of bootstrap procedures to approximate forecast densities and their intervals and regions for multivariate time series data. In particular, we develop bootstrap procedures for VAR and DCC models which are often implemented when modeling and forecasting macroeconomic and financial time series. The bootstrap methodology considered in this thesis is attractive since it is free of distributional assumptions and well suited to incorporate the parameter uncertainty and can be even designed to deal with the model uncertainty. Chapter 1 introduces the VAR and DCC models and the standard approach to construct forecast densities within them. The problems that arise when forecasting these models push us to consider alternatives, some of them based on bootstrapping. By then, it will be a propitious time to briefly introduce the bootstrap methodology for time dependent data and review its implementation to forecast problems. Chapter 2 establishes the asymptotic validity and analyses the finite sample performance of a simple bootstrap procedure to construct multi-step multivariate forecast densities in the context of non-Gaussian unrestricted VAR models. This bootstrap procedure avoids the backward representation used by existing alternatives and, consequently, can be implemented to obtain multivariate forecast densities in, for example, VARMA or VAR-GARCH models. In the context of bivariate stationary VAR models, we carry out several Monte Carlo experiments to study its finite sample properties, finding that these are comparable to those of alternatives based on the backward representation. Hence we remark that nothing is lost when we abandon the more complicated backward representation. This result is also suggested by one of the empirical applications, in which we construct joint forecast densities of US quarterly inflation, unemployment and GDP growth and the corresponding forecast regions with their empirical coverages obtained using a rolling window scheme. Finally, we reproduce a textbook example that applies the standard Gaussian methodology to forecast West German investment, consumption and income and then, for comparison purposes, we include the bootstrap forecast intervals. The model, the parameters and the error distribution are rarely known without uncertainty by the forecaster and, thus, the sampling variability caused by the use of the estimated model needs to be taken into account. Bootstrap methods are successfully designed to deal with different sources of uncertainties in the context of forecasting VAR models. For this reason, Chapter 3 compares the forecast performance of the regions constructed using the traditional Gaussian methodology and several variants of the bootstrap procedure that successively incorporate error distribution, parameter uncertainty, bias correction and lag order uncertainty. Our Monte Carlo study suggests that the parameter uncertainty plays a prominent role when forecasting highly persistent VAR models. Regarding DCC forecast, there are two problem that deserve attention. First, the non-Gaussianity of returns demands alternative ways of approximating its forecast density. Second, only point forecasts of volatilities, covariances and correlations can be obtained at each moment of time. These issues encouraged us to developed bootstrap procedure to forecast returns, volatilities, covariances and correlations in corrected DCC models, which is described in Chapter 4. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations in order to evaluate its finite sample properties, which show a rather good performance of the bootstrap procedure under different sample sizes and error distributions. We apply the proposed bootstrap algorithm to two systems of returns. First, we obtain out-of-sample forecast of returns, volatilities, covariances and correlations in the context of a system of daily exchange rates returns of the Euro, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollar against the US Dollar. Second, we construct within sample forecast intervals of the conditional correlation of SandP 500 and NASDAQ returns. Both empirical applications point out that our bootstrap algorithm can provide additional information that enriches the DCC forecast approach. Finally, Chapter 5 concludes and presents the research lines that are still open.},

An ensemble composed of three methods (decision tree, gradient boosted trees and random forest) is proposed due to the good results these methods have achieved in previous big data applications. The weights of the ensemble are computed by a weighted least square method. Two strategies related to the weight update are considered, leading to a static or dynamic ensemble model. The predictions for each ensemble member are obtained by dividing the forecasting problem into hh forecasting sub-problems, one for each value of the prediction horizon. These sub-problems have been solved using machine learning algorithms from the big data engine Apache Spark, ensuring the scalability of our methodology. The performance of the proposed ensemble models is evaluated on Spanish electricity consumption data for 10 years measured with a 10-minute frequency. The results showed that both the dynamic and static ensembles performed well, outperforming the individual ensemble members they combine. The dynamic ensemble was the most accurate model achieving a MRE of 2\%, which is a very promising result for the prediction of big time series. Proposed ensembles are also evaluated using solar power from Australia for two years measured with 30-min frequency. The results are successfully compared with Artificial Neural Network, Pattern Sequence-based Forecasting and Deep Learning, improving their results.},

Either the deterministic or the stochastic structure of a vector autoregressive error correction model of the system is assumed to be affected by the intervention. The information about the intervention effect is just provided by some linear restrictions imposed on the future values of the variables involved.

Formulas for restricted forecasts with intervention effects and their mean squared errors are derived as a particular case of Catlin's static updating theorem.

The central theme in all the available clustering algorithms is the dissimilarity measure employed by the algorithm. The dissimilarity measures, applicable in financial domain, as used or suggested in past researches, are correlation based dissimilarity measure, temporal correlation based dissimilarity measure and dynamic time wrapping (DTW) based dissimilarity measure. One shortcoming of these dissimilarity measures is that they do not take into account the lead or lag existing between the returns of different stocks which changes with time. Mostly, such stocks with high value of correlation at some lead or lag belong to the same cluster (or sector). The present paper, proposes two new dissimilarity measures which show superior clustering results as compared to past measures when compared over 3 data sets comprising of 526 companies.},

  abstract             = {In this paper, our analysis of exchange rate prediction builds upon on the factor approach proposed by Engel, Mark and West (2015). Our analysis is applied to 13 OECD currencies 1991:01-2013:04 quoted in US dollars at a monthly frequency. Following the Engel et al. (2015) approach factors do not rely on economic fundamentals, but are extracted from the panel of exchange rates. The underlying rationale is exchange rate series tend to co-move over time and thus contain information that is hard to extract from observable fundamentals. Thereafter these factors and economic fundamentals are used to demonstrate a degree of predictability in foreign exchange. We contribute the existing literature by augmenting Engel et al.'s (2015) approach by utilising a more exhaustive set of economic fundamentals for each of these economies. Whilst Engel et al. test forecasting models against the random walk, we adopt a more comprehensive forecasting exercise addressing the performance of each competing model to try to determine which model is best able to forecast spot exchange rates in each economy tested. Finally, we examine the effect of the recent financial crisis on our forecasting models. For the full sample, forecasting results demonstrate that models which relied on PPP fundamentals did particular well at beating the random walk across a large cross-section of economies. However, in a horse race of all competing forecasting models a surprising level heterogeneity in model performance is uncovered. Turning to how the forecasts were affected by the crisis, results indicate that, across all economies, the random walk is more readily rejected during the crisis period. Whilst this result is expected, comparing forecasting performance between economies again uncovers a surprising degree of heterogeneity.},

These consist of a portfolio switching approach, a mean-variance framework, and a long-run dynamic model. The authors find a disconnect between the statistical perspective, whereby the ratios yield a modest forecasting power, and a portfolio approach, by which a moderate predictability is often sufficient to yield significant portfolio outperformance, especially before transaction costs and when regimes are taken into account. However, also when regimes are considered, predictability gives high payoffs only to long horizon, highly risk-averse investors. Moreover, different strategies deliver different performance rankings across predictors.},

A primary reason has been that traditional CAPE regressions assume the CAPE ratio reverts mechanically to its long-run average, regardless of the macroeconomic environment. In this article, the authors propose an enhancement to standard CAPE-based forecasts that conditions mean reversion in the CAPE ratio on real (not nominal) bond yields, expected inflation rates, and financial volatility in a VAR model. The forecasted results are promising for both real and nominal returns, with out-of-sample forecast errors approximately 50\% lower than traditional approaches. The differences are economically meaningful and statistically significant over the forecast period examined. At present, low real bond yields imply low real earnings yields and an above-average "fair-value" CAPE ratio. Nevertheless, with Shiller's CAPE ratio now well above its fair value, the model proposed by the author predicts nominal U.S. stock returns centered near 5\% over the next decade.},

By contrast, the model-averaged forecasts based on both parametric (Autoregressive Integrated model) and non-parametric models (-HW) are able to provide improved forecasts, particularly for the ten trading days ahead forecasting horizon. For robustness purposes, we build two trading strategies based on the aforementioned forecasts, which further confirm that the -HW and the ARI--HW are able to generate significantly higher net daily returns in the out-of-sample period.},

We consider absolute and relative predictive ability to test a range of competing risk models, focusing on value-at-risk and expected shortfall (ExS). In devising the test for the absolute predictive ability, we take the route of recent literature and construct balanced simultaneous confidence sets that control for the generalized family-wise error rate, which is the joint probability of rejecting true hypotheses. We implement a step-down method which increases the power of the MHT in isolating false discoveries. In testing for the ExS model predictive ability, we design a new simple test to draw inference about recursive model forecasting capability. In the second suite of statistical testing, we develop a novel device for measuring the relative predictive ability in the bootstrap MHT framework. The device, which we coin multiple comparison mapping, provides a statistically robust instrument designed to answer the question: 'Which model is the best model?'},

They have to stand up to comparable point-data models of the well-known capital asset pricing model type which employ single daily returns based on successive closing prices and might allow for GARCH effects in a comprehensive out-of-sample forecasting competition. The latter comprises roughly 1000 daily observations on all 30 stocks that constitute the DAX, Germany's main stock index, for a period covering both the calm market phase before and the more turbulent times during the recent financial crisis. The interval data models clearly outperform simple random walk benchmarks as well as the point-data competitors in the great majority of cases. This result does not only hold when one-day-ahead forecasts of the conditional variance are considered, but is even more evident when the focus is on forecasting the width or the exact location of the next day's return interval. Regression models based on interval arithmetic thus prove to be a promising alternative to established point-data volatility forecasting tools.},

In addition to the usual stylized facts of skewness and leptokurtosis, the model also accommodates leverage and contagion effects, but is i.i.d., and thus does not embody, for example, a GARCH-type structure. Owing to analytic tractability of the moments and the expected shortfall, portfolio optimization is straightforward, and, for daily equity returns data, is shown to substantially outperform the equally weighted and classical long-only Markowitz framework, as well as DCC-GARCH (despite not using any kind of GARCH-type filter).},

A three-factor model comprising a forward spread, a weighted combination of forward rates, and a macro factor generates notable gains in out-of-sample forecast accuracy compared with a model based on the expectations hypothesis. Such gains in predictive accuracy translate into higher risk-adjusted portfolio returns after accounting for estimation error and model uncertainty. Consistent with models featuring unspanned macro factors, our forecasts of future bond excess returns are strongly negatively correlated with survey forecasts of short rates.},

The predictor variables investigated are those typical of the literature featuring a range of macroeconomic and market leading indicators. Our out-of-sample forecasting exercises are conducted with reference to US, UK, French and German data, both stocks and bonds, and for 1- and 12-months-ahead horizons. We employ several forecast performance metrics and predictive accuracy tests. Internet-search-based models are found to perform better than the average of all of the alternative models. For several country-asset-horizon combinations, particularly for UK bond returns, our heuristic models compare favourably with sophisticated econometric methods. The heuristic models are also shown to perform well in forecasting realized volatility. The baseline results are supported by several extensions and robustness checks, such as using alternative search keywords, controlling for Fama-French and Cochrane-Piazzesi factors, and implementing heuristic-based trading strategies.},

  abstract             = {This paper considers forecasting in a big data environment. We develop a category of nonlinear forecasting based on factor models to benefit from many potential predictors while accounting for any possible nonlinear dynamics within the environment. The problem of forecasting with factor models is a two-step procedure. Proposed model, at the first step, employs an autoassociative neural networkto estimate nonlinear factors from a large panel of predictors, and at the second step, applies a nonlinear function on the estimated factors to predict a single time series. Such features can go beyond the covariance structure analysis and enhance the accuracy of forecasting. Applying this approach to forecast equity returns, the proposed model captures the nonlinear dynamic between equities to enhance the performance of the subsequent forecast. This offers a significant improvement to current univariate and multivariate models. We emphasize the fact that linear models can be seen as a special case of the proposed nonlinear model, which basically implies that in the event that nonlinearity is absent between series, the model will subsequently be reduced to a linear model. The empirical results on daily returns of equities on the SandP 500 index from 2005 - 2014 proved the superiority of the out-of-sample forecasting ability of this model vis-a-vis competing approaches.},

This method enables building in-sample and out-of-sample bootstrap datasets that do not overlap but exhibit the same time dependencies. We show in a simulation study that this technique drastically reduces the mean squared error of the estimated predictive ability. We illustrate our methodology on IBM, MSFT and DJIA stock prices, where we compare 11 trading rules specifications. For the considered datasets, two different filter rule specifications have the highest out-of-sample mean excess returns. However, all tested rules cannot beat a simple buy-and-hold strategy when trading at a daily frequency.},

In contrast to financial theory and in line with previous findings, we do not find a positive cross-sectional relationship between risk and return.

Viewed in this way, asset pricing studies can be revisited using multi-layer deep learners, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or long-short-term-memory (LSTM) for time-series effects. State-of-the-art algorithms including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), TensorFlow and dropout design provide imple- mentation and efficient factor exploration. To illustrate our methodology, we revisit the equity market risk premium dataset of Welch and Goyal (2008). We find the existence of nonlinear factors which explain predictability of returns, in particular at the extremes of the characteristic space. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.},

With an economic objective to minimize pricing errors, we train a non-reduced-form neural network using firm characteristics [inputs], and generate factors [intermediate features], to fit security returns [outputs]. Sorting securities on firm characteristics provides a nonlinear activation to create long-short portfolio weights, as a hidden layer, from lag characteristics to realized returns. Our model offers an alternative perspective for dimension reduction on firm characteristics [inputs], rather than factors [intermediate features], and allows for both nonlinearity and interactions on inputs. Our empirical findings are twofold. We find robust statistical and economic evidence in out-of-sample portfolios and individual stock returns. To interpret our deep factors, we show highly significant results in factor investing via the squared Sharpe ratio test, as well as improvement in dissecting anomalies.},

  abstract       = {In the last decade, the problem of forecasting time series in very different fields has received increasing attention due to its many real-world applications. In particular, in the very challenging case of financial time series, the underlying phenomenon of stock time series exhibits complex behaviors, including non-stationary, non-linearity and non-trivial scaling properties. In the literature, a wide-used strategy to improve the forecasting capability is the combination of several models. However, the majority of the published researches in the field of financial time series use different machine learning models where only one type of predictor, either linear or nonlinear, is considered. In this paper we first measure relevant features present in the underlying process to propose a forecast method. We select the Sample Entropy and Hurst Exponent to characterize the behavior of stock time series. The characterization reveals the presence of moderate randomness, long-term memory and scaling properties. Thus, based on the measured properties, this paper proposes a novel one-step-ahead off-line meta-learning model, called mu-XNW, for the prediction of the next value xt+1 of a financial time series xt, that integrates a naive or linear predictor (LP), for which the predicted value of xt + 1 is just repeating the last value xt, an extreme learning machine (ELM) and a discrete wavelet transform (DWT), both based on the n previous values of xt + 1. LP, ELM and DWT are the constituent of the proposed model mu-XNW. We evaluate the proposed model using four well-known performance measures and validated the usefulness of the model using six high-frequency stock time series belong to the technology sector. The experimental results validate that including internal estimators that are able to the capture the relevant features measured (randomness, long-term memory and scaling properties) successfully improve the accuracy of the forecasting over methods that do not include them.},

Furthermore, we hope to outline recent key advancements in the technology, and provide insight into areas, in which deep learning can improve investigation, as well as highlight new areas of research that have yet to see the application of deep learning, but could nonetheless benefit immensely.

In this paper, we are using four types of deep learning architectures i.e Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting the stock price of a company based on the historical prices available. Here we are using day-wise closing price of two different stock markets, National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The network was trained with the stock price of a single company from NSE and predicted for five different companies from both NSE and NYSE. It has been observed that CNN is outperforming the other models. The network was able to predict for NYSE even though it was trained with NSE data. This was possible because both the stock markets share some common inner dynamics. The results obtained were com- pared with ARIMA model and it has been observed that the neural networks are outperforming the existing linear model (ARIMA).},

  abstract       = {This paper deals with inference and prediction for multiple correlated time series, where one has also the choice of using a candidate pool of contemporaneous predictors for each target series. Starting with a structural model for the time-series, Bayesian tools are used for model fitting, prediction, and feature selection, thus extending some recent work along these lines for the univariate case. The Bayesian paradigm in this multivariate setting helps the model avoid overfitting as well as capture correlations among the multiple time series with the various state components. The model provides needed flexibility to choose a different set of components and available predictors for each target series. The cyclical component in the model can handle large variations in the short term, which may be caused by external shocks. We run extensive simulations to investigate properties such as estimation accuracy and performance in forecasting. We then run an empirical study with one-step-ahead prediction on the max log return of a portfolio of stocks that involve four leading financial institutions. Both the simulation studies and the extensive empirical study confirm that this multivariate model outperforms three other benchmark models, viz. a model that treats each target series as independent, the autoregressive integrated moving average model with regression (ARIMAX), and the multivariate ARIMAX (MARIMAX) model.},

  abstract             = {Upon the evidence that infinite-order vector autoregression setting is more realistic in time series models, we propose new model selection procedures for producing efficient multistep forecasts. They consist of order selection criteria involving the sample analog of the asymptotic approximation of the h-step-ahead forecast mean squared error matrix, where h is the forecast horizon. These criteria are minimized over a truncation order nT under the assumption that an infinite-order vector autoregression can be approximated, under suitable conditions, with a sequence of truncated models, where nT is increasing with sample size.

Using finite-order vector autoregressive models with various persistent levels and realistic sample sizes, Monte Carlo simulations show that, overall, our criteria outperform conventional competitors. Specifically, they tend to yield better small-sample distribution of the lag-order estimates around the true value, while estimating it with relatively satisfactory probabilities. They also produce more efficient multistep (and even stepwise) forecasts since they yield the lowest h-step-ahead forecast mean squared errors for the individual components of the holding pseudo-data to forecast. Thus estimating the actual autoregressive order as well as the best forecasting model can be achieved with the same selection procedure.

Such results stand in sharp contrast to the belief that parsimony is a virtue in itself, and state that the relative accuracy of strongly consistent criteria such as the Schwarz information criterion, as claimed in the literature, is overstated. Our criteria are new tools extending those previously existing in the literature and hence can suitably be used for various practical situations when necessary.},

A measure of distance based on the Linfinity -norm is applied to a learning sample of multivariate time trajectories, which can be mean- and/or variance-nonstationary. Based on the ranking of distances to the centre of the sample, a subsample of the most central multivariate trajectories is selected. A prediction box is constructed by circumscribing the subsample with a hyperrectangle. The fraction of central trajectories selected into the subsample can be calibrated by bootstrap such that the expected coverage of the box equals a prescribed nominal level. The method is related to the concept of data depth, and thence modified to increase coverage. Applications to simulated and empirical data illustrate the method, which is also compared to several other methods in the literature adapted to the multivariate setting..},

  abstract             = {Inspired by the success of deep learning in big data image recognition in Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine which was the original design to forecast human motion movement had been modified to forecast financial time series. As far as the author is aware of, this is the first attempt to apply deep learning in financial time series forecasting. Conventionally, deep learning is applied in image classification and several layers of deep learning in the huge dataset could increase its accuracy. The traditional forecasting method is using Euclidean distance to map the dataset into a higher dimension which facilitates to draw a hyperplane to separate the data. The more the cluster of the data in the hyperplane, the closer the distance of those neighbour data. As a result, those cluster data are the foundation to forecast. A new approach in Restricted Boltzmann Machine is to assign low energy based on probability concept to those connections that are relevant to each other while high energy is assigned to those that are irrelevant. The advantage of this method over Euclidean distance is that the probability energy assignment can be done one layer at a time and extend to many layers. Each layer information is retained and passed on to another layer to be trained again. As a consequence, all the information in the dataset is carefully scrutinized to obtain the best result. In this research, it has been demonstrated in the following Chapters that deep learning using modified Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine is able to handle high dimensionality data which is over 100 with the dataset array as big as 600000x100. This setup enables it to capture the information of the high dimensions in each layer. Eventually, it will improve the forecasting accuracy. This was not possible before as our previous research has experienced. Historical records are not as important as the dimension of the financial time series problem domain. 30 or 20 years of stock history may not have that much impact on the current stock price in one stock. As the financial market is closely related to other markets, the stock price of a particular security is heavily dependent on other stocks in the same market as well as the performance of other markets. Hence, it is more important to increase the dimensionality or features of the data. In other words, including more factors such as the price of others stocks, economic factors such as interest rates and GDP can enhance the performance. The algorithm based on Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine has demonstrated remarkable forecasting accuracy as reported in Chapter 4 and 5.},

  abstract             = {Multivariate time series forecasting is an important machine learning problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. Temporal data arise in these real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term and short-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressive models and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet), to address this open challenge. LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables, and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to discover long-term patterns and trends. In our evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns, LSTNet achieved significant performance improvements over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods. The dataset and experiment code both are uploaded to Github.},

  abstract             = {In a data-rich environment, forecasting economic variables amounts to extracting and organizing useful information from a large number of predictors. So far, the dynamic factor model and its variants have been the most successful models for such exercises.

In this paper, we investigate a category of LASSO-based approaches and evaluate their predictive abilities for forecasting twenty important macroeconomic variables. These alternative models can handle hundreds of data series simultaneously, and extract useful information for forecasting. We also show, both analytically and empirically, that combing forecasts from LASSO-based models with those from dynamic factor models can reduce the mean square forecast error (MSFE) further.

Our three main findings can be summarized as follows. First, for most of the variables under investigation, all of the LASSO-based models outperform dynamic factor models in the out-of-sample forecast evaluations. Second, by extracting information and formulating predictors at economically meaningful block levels, the new methods greatly enhance the interpretability of the models. Third, once forecasts from a LASSO-based approach are combined with those from a dynamic factor model by forecast combination techniques, the combined forecasts are significantly better than either dynamic factor model forecasts or the na ive random walk benchmark.},

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.},

The general-to-specific approach to the detection of structural change, which is currently implemented in Autometrics via indicator saturation, has proven to be both practical and effective in the context of stationary dynamic regression models and unit-root autoregressions. By focusing on impulse- and step-indicator saturation, we use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the performance of this approach for detecting additive outliers and level shifts in the analysis of nonstationary seasonal time series. The reference model is the basic structural model, featuring a local linear trend, possibly integrated of order two, stochastic seasonality and a stationary component. Further, we apply both kinds of indicator saturation to the detection of additive outliers and level shifts in the industrial production series of five European countries.},

One key component in cluster analysis is determining a proper dissimilarity measure between two data objects, and many criteria have been proposed in the literature to assess dissimilarity between two time series. The R package TSclust is aimed to implement a large set of well-established peer-reviewed time series dissimilarity measures, including measures based on raw data, extracted features, underlying parametric models, complexity levels, and forecast behaviors. Computation of these measures allows the user to perform clustering by using conventional clustering algorithms. TSclust also includes a clustering procedure based on p values from checking the equality of generating models, and some utilities to evaluate cluster solutions. The implemented dissimilarity functions are accessible individually for an easier extension and possible use out of the clustering context. The main features of TSclust are described and examples of its use are presented.},

Previous studies have found that the estimated models change over time, but the implications of the time-varying behavior have not been thoroughly examined. This paper presents an adaptive estimation approach that allows for the parameters of the estimated models to be time varying. It is shown that a two-state Gaussian hidden Markov model with time-varying parameters is able to reproduce the long memory of squared daily returns that was previously believed to be the most difficult fact to reproduce with a hidden Markov model. Capturing the time-varying behavior of the parameters also leads to improved one-step density forecasts. Finally, it is shown that the forecasting performance of the estimated models can be further improved using local smoothing to forecast the parameter variations.},

Our approach benefits from predicting well in volatile periods and especially from extreme market drops.

Momentum is predicted at monthly and annual frequency by book-to-market, at monthly frequency by lagged-one-month return, and at annual frequency by book-to-market together with earnings-price ratio growth. Results are robust to targeted volatility portfolios (Daniel et al. (2013)), but are not robust to leverage constraints, finer portfolios, or industry controls. All other predictors perform poorly, are unstable between sub-samples, and are not robust to various robustness tests. The results suggest links of value to the real economy and that the variety of predictors proposed by the literature are of little value for predicting momentum returns out-of-sample.},

The proposed test improves the asymptotic power by using a more efficient estimator of the parameter being tested than that used in the literature. The estimator used by the standard version of the test depends on the individual predictions and realizations only through the observations on the prediction errors. However, the parameter being tested can also be expressed in terms of moments of the predictors and the predicted variable, some of which cannot be identified separately by the observations on the prediction errors alone. Parameterizing these moments in a GMM framework and drawing on the theory of West (1996), we devise more powerful versions of the test by exploiting a restriction that is maintained routinely under the null hypothesis by West (1996, Assumption 2b) and later studies. This restriction requires only finite second-order moments and covariance stationarity in order to ensure that the population linear projection exists. Simulation experiments show that the potential gains in power can be substantial.},

We contend that the nature of relations between economic variables and returns differs according to the level of inflation, due to different economic risk implications. An increase in low level inflation may signal improving economic conditions and lower expected returns, while the opposite is true with an equal rise in high level inflation. Linear estimation provides contradictory coefficient values, which we argue arises from mixing coefficient values across regimes. We test for and estimate threshold models with inflation and the term structure as the threshold variable. These models reveal a change in either the sign or magnitude of the parameter values across the regimes such that the relation between stock returns and economic variables is not constant. Measures of in-sample fit and a forecast exercise support the threshold models. They produce a higher adjusted R2, lower MAE and RMSE and higher trading related measures. These results help explain the lack of consistent empirical evidence in favour of stock return predictability and should be of interest to those engaged in stock market modelling as well as trading and portfolio management.},

Our variables span categories including financial ratios, macro-, labour market and housing variables as well as others, which incorporate measures of sentiment and leverage. Significant in-sample results occur across these five groups. Of note, price ratios, GDP acceleration, inflation, unemployment and consumer sentiment feature prominently. In conducting out-of-sample forecasts, we utilise a range of forecast performance measures and consider single model and combined forecasts. The results show that, with one exception, the combined model forecasts outperform the single model forecasts across all measures. This supports the view that a range of variables from across the economy can help predict future stock returns.},

  abstract       = {This paper considers whether the cyclical component of the log dividend-price and price-earnings ratios contain forecast power for stock returns. While the levels of these series contain slow moving information for predicting long horizon returns, for short-horizon returns it is the relative movement between prices and fundamental that matters for investors, and whether prices are accelerating away or converging with fundamentals. We use three approaches to extract the cyclical component of these ratios and conduct a range of in-sample and out-of-sample tests. In addition to the cyclical components, we include further predictive variables that account for economic growth and the relation between stocks and bonds. In-sample estimation using the ratio levels reveals results that do not accord with economic intuition. In contrast, using the cyclical component leads to economically sensible values, as well as improved in-sample fit. Out of-sample forecasting reveals that in comparison to a historical mean model, the performance of our predictive models is generally better, although that depends on metrics used to evaluate the forecasts. Moreover, the cyclical component models outperform the levels based models. Notably, the historical mean model is preferred using standard mean absolute and squared errors measures but the predictive models perform better using Mincer-Zarnowitz and related encompassing regressions. Notably, when using economic based forecast evaluation, the predictive models are clearly preferred, with a stronger ability to predict the future direction of return movements and in obtaining higher trading returns. A further examination of the results reveals that this greater performance largely arises from a superior ability to predict future negative returns.},

I demonstrate that the basis between spot and futures contracts predicts future returns across the asset classes. The predictor consistently beats the historical average, producing a median monthly out-of-sample R2, measured over the period between January 1986 and December 2016, of approximately 0.36 a value that is comparable to those of the best equity premium predictors considered in Campbell and Thompson (2008). A simple long-short strategy based on the new predictor delivers an out-of-sample alpha of 2.54.5\% per annum with respect to the asset pricing models considered and produces an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of almost 0.5, which is particularly striking since the strategy is countercyclical. This performance is robust across sub-periods, market environments, portfolio construction methodologies and transaction costs. A cross-sectional structure analysis reveals that two observable common factors, constructed as equally-weighted indices of the bases of financial assets and commodities, are related to the short-term interest rate and the business cycle, respectively.},

  abstract             = {A number of recent studies in the economics literature have focused on the usefulness of factor models in the context of prediction using "big data"(see Bai and Ng, 2008; Dufour and Stevanovic, 2010; Forni, Hallin, Lippi, and Reichlin, 2000; Forni et al., 2005; Kim and Swanson, 2014a; Stock and Watson, 2002b, 2006, 2012, and the references cited therein). We add to this literature by analyzing whether "big data"are useful for modelling low frequency macroeconomic variables, such as unemployment, inflation and GDP. In particular, we analyze the predictive benefits associated with the use of principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and sparse principal component analysis (SPCA). We also evaluate machine learning, variable selection and shrinkage methods, including bagging, boosting, ridge regression, least angle regression, the elastic net, and the non-negative garotte. Our approach is to carry out a forecasting "horse-race"using prediction models that are constructed based on a variety of model specification approaches, factor estimation methods, and data windowing methods, in the context of predicting 11 macroeconomic variables that are relevant to monetary policy assessment. In many instances, we find that various of our benchmark models, including autoregressive (AR) models, AR models with exogenous variables, and (Bayesian) model averaging, do not dominate specifications based on factor-type dimension reduction combined with various machine learning, variable selection, and shrinkage methods (called "combination"models). We find that forecast combination methods are mean square forecast error (MSFE) "best"for only three variables out of 11 for a forecast horizon of h=1, and for four variables when h=3 or 1212. In addition, non-PCA type factor estimation methods yield MSFE-best predictions for nine variables out of 11 for h=1h=1, although PCA dominates at longer horizons. Interestingly, we also find evidence of the usefulness of combination models for approximately half of our variables when h>1h>1. Most importantly, we present strong new evidence of the usefulness of factor-based dimension reduction when utilizing "big data"for macroeconometric forecasting.},

The connections between probability elicitation and classification are used to pose the combining forecaster problem as that of ensemble learning. With this connection in place, a number of theoretically sound ensemble learning methods such as Bagging and Boosting are adapted for combining forecasters. It is shown that the simple yet effective method of averaging the forecasts is equivalent to Bagging. This provides theoretical insight into why the well established averaging of forecasts method works so well. Also, a nonlinear combination of forecasters can be attained through Boosting which is shown to theoretically produce combined forecasters that are both calibrated and highly refined. Finally, the proposed methods of combining forecasters are applied to the Good Judgment Project data set and are shown to outperform the individual forecasters.},

So far, little help in predicting the direction of the company value over the longer period of time has been provided from the machines.

In this paper we present a machine learning aided approach to evaluate the equity's future price over the long time. Our method is able to correctly predict whether some company's value will be 10 percent higher or not over the period of one year in 76.5 percent of cases.},

Previous definitions of dynamic principal components depend on past and future values of the series. For this reason, they are not appropriate for forecasting purposes. On the contrary, it is shown that the ODPC introduced in this paper can be successfully used for forecasting high-dimensional multiple time series. An alternating least squares algorithm to compute the proposed ODPC is presented. We prove that for stationary and ergodic time series the estimated values converge to their population analogues. We also prove that asymptotically, when both the number of series and the sample size go to infinity, if the data follows a dynamic factor model, the reconstruction obtained with ODPC converges, in mean squared error, to the common part of the factor model. Monte Carlo results shows that forecasts obtained by the ODPC compare favourably with other forecasting methods based on dynamic factor models.},

  abstract       = {In a recent study, Bergmeir, Hyndman and Benitez (2016) successfully employed a bootstrap aggregation (bagging) technique for improving the performance of exponential smoothing. Each series is Box-Cox transformed, and decomposed by Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL); then bootstrapping is applied on the remainder series before the trend and seasonality are added back, and the transformation reversed to create bootstrapped versions of the series. Subsequently, they apply automatic exponential smoothing on the original series and the bootstrapped versions of the series, with the final forecast being the equal-weight combination across all forecasts. In this study we attempt to address the question: why does bagging for time series forecasting work? We assume three sources of uncertainty (model uncertainty, data uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty) and we separately explore the benefits of bagging for time series forecasting for each one of them. Our analysis considers 4004 time series (from the M- and M3-competitions) and two families of models. The results show that the benefits of bagging predominantly originate from the model uncertainty: the fact that different models might be selected as optimal for the bootstrapped series. As such, a suitable weighted combination of the most suitable models should be preferred to selecting a single model.},

Using the monthly industry series of the M3 competition, we empirically explore the inventory performances of various widely used forecasting techniques, including exponential smoothing, ARIMA models, the Theta method, and approaches based on multiple temporal aggregation. We employ a rolling simulation approach and analyse the results for the order-up-to policy under various lead times. We find that the methods that are based on combinations result in superior inventory performances, while the Naive, Holt, and Holt-Winters methods perform poorly.},

The methodology of the proposed scheme is examined through benchmark chaotic time series, such as Mackey Glass, Lorenz, Henon maps, the Lynx and rainfall from Santa Francisca - Cordoba, with addition of white noise by using neural networks-based energy associated (EAS) predictor filter modified by Renyi's entropy of the series. When the time series is short or long, the underlying dynamical system is nonlinear and temporal dependencies span long time intervals, in which this are also called long memory process. In such cases, the inherent nonlinearity of neural networks models and a higher robustness to noise seem to partially explain their better prediction performance when entropic information is extracted from the series. Then, to demonstrate that permutation entropy is computationally efficient, robust to outliers, and effective to measure complexity of time series, computational results are evaluated against several non-linear ANN predictors to show the predictability of noisy rainfall and chaotic time series reported in the literature.},

In this work we explore the use of Gaussian Processes in conjunction with a dynamic modeling strategy, much like the Kalman Filter, to model the yield curve. Gaussian Processes have been successfully applied to model functional data in a variety of applications. A Gaussian Process is used to model the yield curve. The hyper-parameters of the Gaussian Process model are updated as the algorithm receives yield curve data. Yield curve data is typically available as a time series with a frequency of one day. We compare existing methods to forecast the yield curve with the proposed method. The results of this study showed that while a competing method (a multivariate time series method) performed well in forecasting the yields at the short term structure region of the yield curve, Gaussian Processes perform well in the medium and long term structure regions of the yield curve. Accuracy in the long term structure region of the yield curve has important practical implications. The Gaussian Process framework yields uncertainty and probability estimates directly in contrast to other competing methods. Analysts are frequently interested in this information. In this study the proposed method has been applied to yield curve forecasting, however it can be applied to model high frequency time series data or data streams in other domains.},

  abstract       = {We examine the impact of price trends on the accuracy of forecasts from prediction markets. In particular, we study an electronic betting exchange market and construct independent variables from market price (odds) time series from 6058 individual markets (a dataset consisting of over 8.4 million price points). Using a conditional logit model, we find that a systematic relationship exists between trends in odds and the accuracy of odds-implied event probabilities; the relationship is consistent with participants over-reacting to price movements. In particular, in different time segments of the market, increasing and decreasing odds lead, respectively, to under- and over-estimation of odds-implied probabilities. We develop a methodology to detect and correct the erroneous forecasts associated with these trends in odds in order to considerably improve the quality of forecasts generated in prediction markets.},

  abstract       = {Stock prices are co-integrated with fundamental valuation factors (earnings, revenue, cash flow, etc.). This has allowed legendary value investors such as Warren Buffett to enjoy tremendous investment success over the long-term. However, the market is efficient at discounting past information and consensus future expectations. Having the ability to read non-obvious information and to have a better prediction at future valuation factors (surprises from consensus estimates) would likely lead to investment outperformance (generating alpha returns) over the long run. In a recently published work, Alberg and Lipton [1] used various artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict companies valuation ratios from their historical fundamental factors and suggested promising results. Aligned with this thought, this research project aims at using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict future fundamental valuation factors of companies and then test investment results by applying active risk-return optimized portfolio strategies [2]. The reasons for choosing LSTM network for this study are the following: (1) like a deep neural network, LSTM is a flexible universal function approximator suited for time-series forecast; (2) LSTM, unlike vanilla version of RNN, does not suffer from gradient problem [3] and is well suited in discovering long-range characteristics, hence its name. Given that LSTM network (or deep neural network in general) enjoys a reputation of being prone to over-fitting to in-sample data, we spend a significant amount of efforts in studying the over-fitting behavior and try to lay out systematic procedures in detecting and mitigating such issues. The current work gives us confidence and excitement that much more can be explored to potentially further improve the prediction performance and investment returns.},

Each series within a cluster is assumed to follow the same model and the data are then pooled for estimation. The classification is model-based and robust to outlier contamination. The robustness is achieved by using the intrinsic mode functions of the Hilbert-Huang transform at lower frequencies.

These functions are found to be robust to outlier contamination. The paper also compares out-of-sample forecast performance of the proposed method with several methods available in the literature. The other forecasting methods considered include vector autoregressive models with or without LASSO, group LASSO, principal component regression, and partial least squares.

The proposed method is found to perform well in out-of-sample forecasting of the monthly unemployment rates of 50 US states.},

Traditionally, the missing values are simply omitted or replaced by means of imputation methods. However, omitting those missing values may cause temporal discontinuity. Imputation methods, on the other hand, may alter the original time series. In this study, we propose a novel forecasting method based on least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). We employ the input patterns with the temporal information which is defined as local time index (LTI). Time series data as well as local time indexes are fed to LSSVM for doing forecasting without imputation. We compare the forecasting performance of our method with other imputation methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method is promising and is worth further investigations.},

The method first built a forecasting model on the history data and then used it to predict future values. Anomalies are assumed to take place if the observed values fall outside a given prediction confidence interval (PCI), which can be calculated by the predicted value and confidence coefficient. The use of PCI as threshold is mainly on the fact that it considers the uncertainty in the data series parameters in the forecasting model to address the suitable threshold selection problem. The method performs fast, incremental evaluation of data as it becomes available, scales to large quantities of data, and requires no preclassification of anomalies. Experiments with different hydrologic real-world time series showed that the proposed methods are fast and correctly identify abnormal data and can be used for hydrologic time series analysis.},

A large amount of methodologies has been developed on this topic, including ARIMA, Holt-Winters, etc. However, their performance is easily undermined by the existence of change points and anomaly points, two structures commonly observed in real data, but rarely considered in the aforementioned methods. In this paper, we propose a novel state space time series model, with the capability to capture the structure of change points and anomaly points, as well as trend and seasonality. To infer all the hidden variables, we develop a Bayesian framework, which is able to obtain distributions and forecasting intervals for time series forecasting, with provable theoretical properties. For implementation, an iterative algorithm with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Kalman filter and Kalman smoothing is proposed. In both synthetic data and real data applications, our methodology yields a better performance in time series forecasting compared with existing methods, along with more accurate change point detection and anomaly detection.},

We introduce Friedman's test statistics to examine whether the differences in point and interval forecast accuracies are statistically significant between methods. We introduce the Nemenyi test statistic to identify which methods give results that are statistically significantly different from others. Using sex-specific and age-specific data from 20 countries, we apply these two test statistics to examine the forecast accuracy obtained from several principal component methods, which can be categorized into coherent and non-coherent forecasting methods.},

The results endorse this hypothesis: small size and value portfolios reflect changes in future investment opportunities. To test the hypothesis, the paper forecasts the equity premium using disaggregated portfolio returns with a partial least squares (PLS) regression approach. PLS is chosen as it is particularly suited to condense a large set of portfolios into a single index. The "index" portfolio obtained from the forecast performs well out of sample and hedges against future market risk, in addition to explaining future market returns in sample. Thus, the index portfolio may be viewed as an additional risk factor in the form of a Merton (1973) state variable. The index places larger weights on small size and value portfolios. This also provides a possible explanation for why equal-weighted portfolios typically perform better out of sample compared to factors implied by traditional mean-variance approaches and asset pricing models.},

In response to this, the current paper develops a new test for predictability in panels where NN is large and T2T2 can be either small or large, or indeed anything in between. This consideration represents an advancement relative to the usual large-NN and large-TT requirement. The new test is also very general, especially when it comes to allowable predictors, and is easy to implement. As an illustration, we consider the Chinese stock market, for which data are available for only 17 years, but where the number of firms is relatively large, 160.},

  abstract             = {This dissertation focuses on two aspects of factor models, testing and forecasting. For testing, we investigate a more general high-dimensional testing problem, with an emphasis on panel data models. Specifically, we propose a novel technique to boost the power of testing a high-dimensional vector against sparse alternatives. Existing tests based on quadratic forms such as the Wald statistic often suffer from low powers, whereas more powerful tests such as thresholding and extreme-value tests require either stringent conditions or bootstrap to derive the null distribution, and often suffer from size distortions. Based on a screening technique, we introduce a ``power enhancement component , which is zero under the null hypothesis with high probability, but diverges quickly under sparse alternatives. The proposed test statistic combines the power enhancement component with an asymptotically pivotal statistic, and strengthens the power under sparse alternatives. As a byproduct, the power enhancement component also consistently identifies the elements that violate the null hypothesis. Next, we consider forecasting a single time series using many predictors when nonliearity is present. We develop a new methodology called sufficient forecasting, by connecting sliced inverse regression with factor models. The sufficient forecasting correctly estimates projections of the underlying factors and provides multiple predictive indices for further investigation. We derive asymptotic results for the estimate of the central space spanned by these projection directions. Our method allows the number of predictors larger than the sample size, and therefore extends the applicability of inverse regression. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves upon a linear forecasting model. Our results are further illustrated in an empirical study of macroeconomic variables, where sufficient forecasting is found to deliver additional predictive power over conventional methods.},

Our empirical analysis shows that the inconsistencies between options and returns and only returns are resolved by the introduction of the time-varying jump risk premia.

Our results suggest that shrinkage of the sample covariance matrix improves neither the forecast accuracy nor the performance of minimum-variance portfolios. In contrast, switching from the sample covariance matrix forecast to a multivariate GARCH forecast reduces forecasting error and portfolio tracking error by at least half.

Our findings also reveal that the exponentially weighted covariance matrix forecast performs only slightly worse than the multivariate GARCH forecast.},

The selected variables are then fed into two distinctive support vector machines (SVR) models that produce one-period-ahead forecasts for the two components. Neural networks (NN) are also considered as an alternative to SVR. The sum of the two forecast components is the final forecast of the proposed scheme. We show that the above implementation exhibits a superior in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting ability when compared to alternative forecasting models.

The relative performance of the regime switching model is benchmarked against other well-known modeling techniques, such as stable, power laws and GARCH models. The empirical results show that the regime switching model increases predictive performance of financial forecasting according to the number of violations and tail-loss tests.

They also yield more theoretically consistent predictions from an empirical asset pricing perspective, and, lead to superior out-of-sample portfolio performance. Overall, a parsimonious Vector Heterogeneous Autoregressive (VHAR) model that involves lagged daily, weekly and monthly realised covariances achieves the best performance out of the competing models. A promising new simple hybrid covariance estimator is developed that exploits option-implied information and high-frequency data while adjusting for the volatility riskpremium. Relative model performance does not change during the global financial crisis, or, if a different forecast horizon, or, intraday sampling frequency is employed. Finally, our evidence remains robust when we consider an alternative sample of U.S. stocks.},

They seek to identify and hold stocks that will have high returns and to avoid stocks that will have low returns. In contrast, a number of equity strategies that have received attention recently do not employ return forecasts at all. Instead, investors form portfolios based on stocks' risk characteristics.

This paper reviews three non-returns-based (ie, risk-based) alternative equity strategies: minimum variance, equal risk contribution and maximum diversification. Minimum variance strategies build intuitive, low-risk portfolios.

Equal risk contribution strategies are hybrids of risk minimizing and equal weighting strategies, and they, too, have intuitive characteristics and can have lower risk. In contrast, maximum diversification strategies are puzzling. Maximum diversification strategies prefer stocks with low correlations, even if they are risky, and since they do not target risk reductions, return increases or Sharpe ratio increases per se, maximum diversification strategies can produce portfolios with desirable characteristics only by accident.},

  abstract             = {Movements of financial variables exhibit extreme fluctuations during periods of economic crisis and times of market uncertainty. They are also affected by institutional policies and intervention of regulatory authorities. These structural changes driving prices and other economic indicators can be captured reasonably by models featuring regime-switching capabilities. Hidden Markov models (HMM) modulating the model parameters to incorporate such regime-switching dynamics have been put forward in recent years, but many of them could still be further improved.

In this research, we aim to address some of the inadequacies of previous regime-switching models in terms of their capacity to provide better forecasts and efficiency in estimating parameters. New models are developed, and their corresponding filtering results are obtained and tested on financial data sets.

The contributions of this research work include the following:

(i) Recursive filtering algorithms are constructed for a regime-switching financial model consistent with no-arbitrage pricing. An application to the filtering and forecasting of futures prices under a multivariate set-up is presented.

(ii) The modelling of risk due to market and funding liquidity is considered by capturing the joint dynamics of three time series (Treasury-Eurodollar spread, VIX and S\&P 500 spread-derived metric), which mirror liquidity levels in the financial markets. HMM filters under a multi-regime mean- reverting model are established.

(iii) Kalman filtering techniques and the change of reference probability-based filtering methods are integrated to obtain hybrid algorithms. A pairs trading investment strategy is supported by the combined power of both HMM and Kalman filters. It is shown that an investor is able to benefit from the proposed interplay of the two filtering methods.

(iv) A zero-delay HMM is devised for the evolution of multivariate foreign exchange rate data under a high-frequency trading environment. Recursive filters for quantities that are functions of a Markov chain are derived, which in turn provide optimal parameter estimates.

(v) An algorithm is designed for the efficient calculation of the joint probability function for the occupation time in a Markov-modulated model for asset returns under a general number of economic regimes. The algorithm is constructed with accessible implementation and practical considerations in mind.},

We focus on date, area of interest, type of neural network, benchmark method, journal and citations. The most applied are multilayer feedforward networks with backpropagation learning performed by gradient descent algorithm. Majority (25.73 of the examined articles were published in Expert Systems with Applications. In recent two decades, artificial neural networks have been extensively used in many business applications. Despite the growing number of research papers, only few studies have been presented focusing on the overview of published findings in this important and popular area. Moreover, the majority of these reviews were introduced more than 15 years ago. The aim of this work is to expand the range of earlier surveys and provide a systematic overview of neural network applications in business between 1994 and 2015. We have covered a total of 412 articles and classified them according to the year of publication, application area, type of neural network, learning algorithm, benchmark method, citations and journal. Our investigation revealed that most of the research has aimed at financial distress and bankruptcy problems, stock price forecasting, and decision support, with special attention to classification tasks. Besides conventional multilayer feedforward network with gradient descent backpropagation, various hybrid networks have been developed in order to improve the performance of standard models. Even though neural networks have been established as well-known method in business, there is enormous space for additional research in order to improve their functioning and increase our understanding of this influential area.},

We demonstrate the forecasting performance of the LSTM and compare it with Gaussian processes (GPs) in time series obtained from the Lorenz 96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and a prototype climate model. The LSTM networks outperform the GPs in short-term forecasting accuracy in all applications considered. A hybrid architecture, extending the LSTM with a mean stochastic model (MSM-LSTM), is proposed to ensure convergence to the invariant measure.

Proper lags are selected by the use of mutual information. Develop algorithms to extract training patterns from historical data. Show the effectiveness of local modeling by experiments on real-world datasets. Time series prediction has been widely used in a variety of applications in science, engineering, finance, etc. There are two different modeling options for constructing forecasting models in time series prediction. Global modeling constructs a model which is independent from user queries. On the contrary, local modeling constructs a local model for each different query from the user. In this paper, we propose a local modeling strategy and investigate the effectiveness of incorporating local modeling with three popular machine learning based forecasting methods, Neural Network (NN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), for time series prediction. Given a series of historical data, a local context of the user query is located and an appropriate number of lags are selected. Then forecasting models are constructed by applying NN, ANFIS, and LS-SVM, respectively. A number of experiments are conducted and the results show that local modeling can enhance the estimation performance of a forecasting method for time series prediction.},

  abstract       = {Stock market forecasting is a vital component of financial systems. However, the stock prices are highly noisy and non-stationary due to the fact that stock markets are affected by a variety of factors. Predicting stock market trend is usually subject to big challenges. The goal of this paper is to introduce a new hybrid, end-to-end approach containing two stages, the Empirical Mode Decomposition and Factorization Machine based Neural Network (EMD2FNN), to predict the stock market trend. To illustrate the method, we apply EMD2FNN to predict the daily closing prices from the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite () index, the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) index and the Standard \& Poor 500 Composite Stock Price Index (S\&P 500), which respectively exhibit oscillatory, upward and downward patterns. The results are compared with predictions obtained by other methods, including the neural network (NN) model, the factorization machine based neural network (FNN) model, the empirical mode decomposition based neural network (EMD2NN) model and the wavelet de-noising-based back propagation (WDBP) neural network model. Under the same conditions, the experiments indicate that the proposed methods perform better than the other ones according to the metrics of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Furthermore, we compute the profitability with a simple long-short trading strategy to examine the trading performance of our models in the metrics of Average Annual Return (AAR), Maximum Drawdown (MD), Sharpe Ratio (SR) and AAR/MD. The performances in two different scenarios, when taking or not taking the transaction cost into consideration, are found economically significant.},

  abstract             = {In this article, the authors apply cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to one of the oldest challenges in finance: predicting returns. For the sake of simplicity, they focus on predicting the direction (either up or down) of several liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and do not attempt to predict the magnitude of price changes. The ETFs serve as asset class proxies. The authors employ approximately five years (from January 2011 to January 2016) of historical, daily data obtained through Yahoo Finance. Using supervised learning classification algorithms, readily available from Python's Scikit-Learn, they employ three powerful techniques: (1) deep neural networks, (2) random forests, and (3) support vector machines (linear and radial basis function). They document the performance of the three algorithms across four information sets: past returns, past volume, dummies for days/months, and a combination of all three. They use a gain criterion to compare classifiers' performance. First, they find that these algorithms work well over one- to three-month horizons. Short-horizon predictability, over days, is extremely difficult, and thus the results support the short-term random walk hypothesis. Second, they document the importance of cross-sectional and intertemporal volume as a powerful information set. Third, they show that many features are needed for predictability because each feature makes very small contributions toward predictability. The authors conclude that ETF returns can be predicted with machine learning algorithms, but practitioners should incorporate prior knowledge of markets and intuition on asset class behavior.},

Our deep factors, hidden neurons in the neural network, are trained greedily with the backward propagation feedback from the loss function that considers both time series and cross-sectional variations. Our conditional forecast generalizes a benchmark, such as CAPM, and includes Fama-French type models as special cases. We have designed a train-validation-test study for monthly U.S. equity returns from 1975 to 2017 and 57 published firm characteristics. In an out-of-sample evaluation, the conditional deep factor model shows a forecasting improvement over the benchmark with factors that offer significant alphas.

In this paper, we present a framework for demystifying the behavior of machine learning models and decomposing their predictions into linear, nonlinear, and interaction components. We also show how to decompose a model predictive efficacy into these same components. Together, this analysis forms a  fingerprint which we use to summarize its key characteristics and illustrate its similarities and differences compared to other models. We present a case study of this approach applying random forest, gradient boosting machine, and neural network models to the challenge of predicting monthly currency returns. We find that all three models reliably identify intuitive effects in the currency market, and that they also find new relationships attributable to nonlinearities and variable interactions. We argue that an understanding of these predictive components may help astute investors generate superior risk-adjusted returns.},

Our approach, that allows for both tradable and non-tradable factors, and is applicable to high dimensional cases, has several desirable properties. First, weak and spurious factors lead to diffuse, and centered at zero, posteriors for their market price of risk, making such factors easily detectable. Second, posterior inference is robust to the presence of such factors. Third, we show that flat priors for risk premia lead to improper marginal likelihoods, rendering model selection invalid. Therefore, we provide a novel prior, that is diffuse for strong factors but shrinks away useless ones, under which posterior probabilities are well behaved, and can be used for factor and (non necessarily nested) model selection, as well as model averaging, in large scale problems.

Our cross-section of portfolios is a small number of long-only strategies that (a) fully reflect the information in the cross-sectional return predictors, allowing for conditional interactions and non-linearities, (b) provide a small set of interpretable test assets for evaluating asset pricing models, (c) are substantially harder to price than conventional double or triple sorted portfolios constructed from the same information set, and (d) are the building blocks for a stochastic discount factor (SDF) projected on the characteristic space. We use decision trees to generalize the concept of conventional sorting, and develop a novel approach to the robust recovery of a sparse set of the SDF basis assets. Empirically, we show that traditionally sorted portfolios and factors present a too low hurdle for candidate models as they miss the complex information structure of the original returns. Our results have important implications for evaluating asset pricing models, and modeling expected returns.},

With fewer variables (based on past returns, size, volume, and accounting information) as inputs, we arrive at a conclusion similar to that in previous studies predicting U.S. stock returns with hundreds of stock characteristics and macroeconomic variables; complex methods outperform linear models in terms of both predicting returns and generating profits. We achieve even stronger results when the models are trained separately for each market, allowing for country-specific return-characteristic relationships. In most markets, we obtain out-of-sample R2 and Sharpe ratios that are comparable to those in previous studies. Neural network models, which can handle complicated interactions among the predictors, produce the best results among various machine learning methods.},

There are major contributions in this paper which include the introduction of an input selection criterion when utilizing an expansive universe of inputs, a hybrid combination of partial swarm optimizer (PSO) with radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, the application of a PSO algorithm to a traditional autoregressive moving model (ARMA), the application of a PSO algorithm to a higher-order neural network and, finally, the introduction of a multi-objective algorithm to optimize statistical and trading performance when trading an index. All the machine learning-based methodologies and the conventional models are adapted and optimized to model the index. A PSO algorithm is used to optimize the weights in a traditional RBF neural network, in a higher-order neural network (HONN) and the AR and MA terms of an ARMA model. In terms of checking the statistical and empirical accuracy of the novel models, we benchmark them with a traditional HONN, with an ARMA, with a moving average convergence/divergence model (MACD) and with a naive strategy. More specifically, the trading and statistical performance of all models is investigated in a forecast simulation of the FTSE 100 and DAX 30 ETF time series over the period January 2004 to December 2015 using the last 3 years for out-of-sample testing. Finally, the empirical and statistical results indicate that the PSO-RBF model outperforms all other examined models in terms of trading accuracy and profitability, even with mixed inputs and with only autoregressive inputs.},

As the granularity at which forecasts are needed increases, traditional statistical time series models may not scale well. We apply deep neural networks in the forecasting domain by experimenting with techniques from Natural Language Processing (Encoder-Decoder LSTMs) and Computer Vision (Dilated CNNs), as well as incorporating transfer learning. A novel contribution of this paper is the application of curriculum learning to neural network models built for time series forecasting. We illustrate the performance of our models using Microsoft's revenue data corresponding to Enterprise, and Small, Medium and Corporate products, spanning approximately 60 regions across the globe for 8 different business segments, and totaling in the order of tens of billions of USD. We compare our models' performance to the ensemble model of traditional statistics and machine learning techniques currently used by Microsoft Finance. With this in-production model as a baseline, our experiments yield an approximately 30\% improvement in overall accuracy on test data. We find that our curriculum learning LSTM-based model performs best, showing that it is reasonable to implement our proposed methods without overfitting on medium-sized data.},

The performance of the ANN model in forecasting NIFTY index returns is evaluated by comparing it for different sample periods in terms of forecasting error functions with statistical measures like mean absolute error, root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error and mean square error.

  abstract       = {The M4 Competition follows on from the three previous M competitions, the purpose of which was to learn from empirical evidence both how to improve the forecasting accuracy and how such learning could be used to advance the theory and practice of forecasting. The aim of M4 was to replicate and extend the three previous competitions by: (a) significantly increasing the number of series, (b) expanding the number of forecasting methods, and (c) including prediction intervals in the evaluation process as well as point forecasts. This paper covers all aspects of M4 in detail, including its organization and running, the presentation of its results, the top-performing methods overall and by categories, its major findings and their implications, and the computational requirements of the various methods. Finally, it summarizes its main conclusions and states the expectation that its series will become a testing ground for the evaluation of new methods and the improvement of the practice of forecasting, while also suggesting some ways forward for the field.},

  abstract       = {Stochastic Volatility (SV) models are widely used in the financial sector while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are successfully used in many large-scale industrial applications of Deep Learning. Our article combines these two methods in a non-trivial way and proposes a model, which we call the LSTM-SV model, to capture the dynamics of stochastic volatility. The proposed model overcomes the short-term memory problem in conventional SV models, is able to capture non-linear dependence in the latent volatility process, and often has a better out-of-sample forecast performance than SV models. These properties are illustrated through simulation study and applications to three financial time series datasets: The US stock market weekly index SP500, the Australian stock weekly index ASX200 and the Australian-US dollar daily exchange rates. Based on our analysis, we argue that there are significant differences in the underlying dynamics between the volatility process of the SP500 and ASX200 datasets and that of the exchange rate dataset. For the stock index data, there is strong evidence of long-term memory and non-linear dependence in the volatility process, while this is not the case for the exchange rates.

  abstract       = {We present a model-free forecast algorithm that dynamically combines multiple forecasts using multivariate time series data. The underlying principle is based on the fact that forecast performance depends on the position in the state space. This property is exploited to weight multiple forecasts via a local loss function. Specifically, additional weights are assigned to appropriate forecasts depending on their positions in a state space reconstructed via delay coordinates. The function evaluates the forecast error discounted by the distance in the space, whereas most existing methods discount the error in relation to time. In addition, forecasts are selected with the function for each time step based on the existing multiview embedding approach; by contrast, the original multiview embedding selects the reconstructions in advance before starting the forecast. The proposed prediction method has the smallest mean squared error among conventional ensemble methods for the Rossler and the Lorenz 96I models. The results of comparison of the proposed method with conventional machine-learning methods using a flood forecast example indicate that the proposed method yields superior accuracy. We also demonstrate that the proposed method might even correctly forecast the maximum water level of rivers without any prior knowledge.},

We test the proposed architecture on the well-known M4 competition dataset containing 100k time series from diverse domains.

The first configuration of our model does not employ any time-series-specific components and its performance on the M4 dataset strongly suggests that, contrarily to received wisdom, deep learning primitives such as residual blocks are by themselves sufficient to solve a wide range of forecasting problems.

Applications range from health care to astronomy, and include climate modelling, financial trading and monitoring of critical engineering equipment. To offer value over this range of activities, models must not only provide accurate forecasts, but also quantify and adjust their uncertainty over time. In this work, we directly tackle this task with a novel, fully end-to-end deep learning method for time series forecasting. By recasting time series forecasting as an ordinal regression task, we develop a principled methodology to assess long-term predictive uncertainty and describe rich multimodal, non-Gaussian behaviour, which arises regularly in applied settings. Notably, our framework is a wholly general-purpose approach that requires little to no user intervention to be used. We showcase this key feature in a large-scale benchmark test with 45 datasets drawn from both, a wide range of real-world application domains, as well as a comprehensive list of synthetic maps. This wide comparison encompasses state-of-the-art methods in both the Machine Learning and Statistics modelling literature, such as the Gaussian Process. We find that our approach does not only provide excellent predictive forecasts, shadowing true future values, but also allows us to infer valuable information, such as the predictive distribution of the occurrence of critical events of interest, accurately and reliably even over long time horizons.},

We introduce here a novel approach for learning a nonlinear differential equation model aimed at capturing brain dynamics. Specifically, we propose a variable-projection optimization approach to estimate the parameters of the multivariate (coupled) van der Pol oscillator, and demonstrate that such a model can accurately represent nonlinear dynamics of the brain data. Furthermore, in order to improve the predictive accuracy when forecasting future brain-activity time series, we use this analytical model as an unlimited source of simulated data for pretraining LSTM; such model-specific data augmentation approach consistently improves LSTM performance on both calcium and fMRI imaging data.},

Most of these algorithms require a number of user-defined parameters to be specified, leading to exponential explosion of the space of potential solutions. Since the trial-and-error approach to finding a good algorithm for solving a given problem is typically intractable, researchers and practitioners need to resort to a more intelligent search strategy, with one option being to constraint the search space using past experience - an approach known as Meta-learning. Although potentially attractive, Meta-learning comes with its own challenges. Gathering a sufficient number of Meta-examples, which in turn requires collecting and processing multiple datasets from each problem domain under consideration is perhaps the most prominent issue. In this paper, we are investigating the situations in which the use of additional data can improve performance of a Meta-learning system, with focus on cross-domain transfer of Meta-knowledge. A similarity-based cluster analysis of Meta-features has also been performed in an attempt to discover homogeneous groups of time-series with respect to Meta-learning performance. Although the experiments revealed limited room for improvement over the overall best base-learner, the Meta-learning approach turned out to be a safe choice, minimizing the risk of selecting the least appropriate base-learner.},

Ensemble methods have gained considerable attention from machine learning and soft computing communities in recent years. There are several practical and theoretical reasons, mainly statistical reasons, why an ensemble may be preferred. Ensembles are recognized as one of the most successful approaches to prediction tasks. Previous theoretical studies of ensembles have shown that one of the key reasons for this performance is diversity among ensemble members. Several methods exist to generate diversity. Extensive works in literature suggest that substantial improvements in accuracy can be achieved by combining forecasts from different models. The focus of this chapter will be on ensemble for time series prediction. We describe the use of ensemble methods to compare different models for time series prediction and extensions to the classical ensemble methods for neural networks for classification and regression prediction by using different model architectures. Design, implementation and application will be the main topics of the chapter, and more specifically: conditions under which ensemble based systems may be more beneficial than their single machine; algorithms for generating individual components of ensemble systems; and various procedures through which they can be combined. Various ensemble based algorithms will be analyzed: Bagging, Adaboost and Negative Correlation; as well as combination rules and decision templates. Finally, future directions will be time series forecasting, machine fusion and others areas in which ensemble of machines have shown great promise.},

However, in a situation where large quantities of related time series are available, conditioning the forecast of an individual time series on past behaviour of similar, related time series can be beneficial. Since the product assortment hierarchy in an E-commerce platform contains large numbers of related products, in which the sales demand patterns can be correlated, our attempt is to incorporate this cross-series information in a unified model. We achieve this by globally training a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) that exploits the non-linear demand relationships available in an E-commerce product assortment hierarchy. Aside from the forecasting framework, we also propose a systematic pre-processing framework to overcome the challenges in the E-commerce business. We also introduce several product grouping strategies to supplement the LSTM learning schemes, in situations where sales patterns in a product portfolio are disparate. We empirically evaluate the proposed forecasting framework on a real-world online marketplace dataset from this http URL.

Accounting for the multi-seasonal patterns becomes necessary to generate more accurate and meaningful forecasts in these contexts. In this paper, we propose Long Short-Term Memory Multi-Seasonal Net (LSTM-MSNet), a decompositionbased, unified prediction framework to forecast time series with multiple seasonal patterns. The current state of the art in this space are typically univariate methods, in which the model parameters of each time series are estimated independently. Consequently, these models are unable to include key patterns and structures that may be shared by a collection of time series. In contrast, LSTM-MSNet is a globally trained Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), where a single prediction model is built across all the available time series to exploit the crossseries knowledge in a group of related time series. Furthermore, our methodology combines a series of state-of-the-art multiseasonal decomposition techniques to supplement the LSTM learning procedure. In our experiments, we are able to show that on datasets from disparate data sources, like e.g. the popular M4 forecasting competition, a decomposition step is beneficial, whereas in the common real-world situation of homogeneous series from a single application, exogenous seasonal variables or no seasonal preprocessing at all are better choices. All options are readily included in the framework and allow us to achieve competitive results for both cases, outperforming many state-ofthe-art multi-seasonal forecasting methods},

In recent years, a recommender system scheme has been developed for time series analysis using a meta-learning approach. This system selects the best forecasting method with consideration of the time series characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to focusing on some of the unanswered questions resulting from the use of meta-learning in time series forecasting. Therefore, three main gaps in previous works are addressed including, analyzing various subsets of top forecasters as inputs for meta-learners; evaluating the effect of forecasting error measures; and assessing the role of the dimensionality of the feature space on the forecasting errors of meta-learners. All of these objectives are achieved with the help of a diverse state-of-the-art pool of forecasters and meta-learners. For this purpose, first, a pool of forecasting algorithms is implemented on the NN5 competition dataset and ranked based on the two error measures. Then, six machine-learning classifiers known as meta-learners, are trained on the extracted features of the time series in order to assign the most suitable forecasting method for the various subsets of the pool of forecasters. Furthermore, two-dimensionality reduction methods are implemented in order to investigate the role of feature space dimension on the performance of meta-learners. In general, it was found that meta-learners were able to defeat all of the individual benchmark forecasters; this performance was improved even after applying the feature selection method.},

  abstract             = {Recently, combination algorithms from machine learning classification have been extended to time series regression, most notably seven variants of the popular AdaBoost algorithm. Despite their theoretical promise their empirical accuracy in forecasting has not yet been assessed, either against each other or against any established approaches of forecast combination, model selection, or statistical benchmark algorithms. Also, none of the algorithms have been assessed on a representative set of empirical data, using only few synthetic time series. We remedy this omission by conducting a rigorous empirical evaluation using a representative set of 111 industry time series and a valid and reliable experimental design. We develop a full-factorial design over derived Boosting meta-parameters, creating 42 novel Boosting variants, and create a further 47 novel Boosting variants using research insights from forecast combination. Experiments show that only few Boosting meta-parameters increase accuracy, while meta-parameters derived from forecast combination research outperform others.},

Finally, we conduct a Monte Carlo experimental study that compares and evaluates the bias and variance performance of the different strategies. From the theoretical and the simulation studies, we analyze the effect of different factors, such as the forecast horizon and the time series length, on the bias and variance components, and on the different multistep-ahead strategies.

In traditional forecasting, it is common practice to reserve a part from the end of each time series for testing, and to use the rest of the series for training. Thus it is not made full use of the data, but theoretical problems with respect to temporal evolutionary effects and dependencies within the data as well as practical problems regarding missing values are eliminated. On the other hand, when evaluating machine learning and other regression methods used for time series forecasting, often cross-validation is used for evaluation, paying little attention to the fact that those theoretical problems invalidate the fundamental assumptions of cross-validation. To close this gap and examine the consequences of different model selection procedures in practice, we have developed a rigorous and extensive empirical study. Six different model selection procedures, based on (i) cross-validation and (ii) evaluation using the series' last part, are used to assess the performance of four machine learning and other regression techniques on synthetic and real-world time series. No practical consequences of the theoretical flaws were found during our study, but the use of cross-validation techniques led to a more robust model selection. To make use of the - best of both worlds-, we suggest that the use of a blocked form of cross-validation for time series evaluation became the standard procedure, thus using all available information and circumventing the theoretical problems.},

However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often omitted by practitioners in favor of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. In this paper, we show that the particular setup in which time series forecasting is usually performed using Machine Learning methods renders the use of standard K-fold CV possible. We present theoretical insights supporting our arguments. Furthermore, we present a simulation study where we show empirically that K-fold CV performs favorably compared to both OOS evaluation and other time-series-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation.},

The time series forecasting has a great impact on our socio-economic environment. Hence, to deal with these challenges its need to be redefined the DNN model and keeping this in mind, data pre-processing, network architecture and network parameters are need to be consider before feeding the data into DNN models. Data normalization is the basic data pre-processing technique form which learning is to be done. The effectiveness of time series forecasting is heavily depend on the data normalization technique. In this paper, different normalization methods are used on time series data before feeding the data into the DNN model and we try to find out the impact of each normalization technique on DNN to forecast the time series. Here the Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) is used to predict the closing index of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by using BSE and NYSE time series data.},

The finding of near-unit-root effects in the inflation and inflation expectations series motivates the use of a local-to-unity specification of the inflation process that enables us to test whether the data are generated by locally non-stationary or stationary processes. Thus, we test, rather than assume, stationarity of near-unit-root processes. The paper combines the concept of localities in the underlying time series, such as those that may exist in the sample but not in the population, with cointegration analysis which permits the distinction between short-run and long-run structures. Thus, we examine possible in-sample departures from rationality both in the short run and the long run. Our empirical results indicate that the rational expectations hypothesis holds in the long run, while forecasters adjust their expectations slowly in the short run. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that the persistence of inflation comes from the dynamics of expectations.},

We propose DeepAD, an anomaly detection framework that leverages a plethora of time-series forecasting models in order to detect anomalies more accurately, irrespective of the underlying complex patterns to be learnt. Our solution does not rely on the labels of the anomalous class for training the model, nor for optimizing the threshold based on highest detection given the labels in the training data. We compare our framework against EGADS framework on real and synthetic data with varying time-series characteristics.

The task is particularly challenging due to the sparseness of the data samples and the complex interactions amongst the variables. At the same time, it is of high significance because of the important and paradigmatic role played by the US market in the world economy. Four data-driven artificial intelligence approaches are considered: a manually built fuzzy logic model, a machine learned fuzzy logic model, a self-organising map model, and a multi-layer perceptron model. Their prediction accuracy is compared with that of two classical approaches: a statistical ARIMA model and an econometric error correction model. The algorithms are evaluated on a complete series of end-month US 10-year Treasury bonds yields and economic indicators from 1986:1 to 2004:12. In terms of prediction accuracy and reliability, the best results are obtained by the three parametric regression algorithms, namely the econometric, the statistical, and the multi-layer perceptron model. Due to the sparseness of the learning data samples, the manual and the automatic fuzzy logic approaches fail to follow with adequate precision the range of variations of the US 10-year Treasury bonds. For similar reasons, the self-organising map model performs unsatisfactorily. Analysis of the results indicates that the econometric model has a slight edge over the statistical and the multi-layer perceptron models. This suggests that pure data-driven induction may not fully capture the complicated mechanisms ruling the changes in interest rates. Overall, the prediction accuracy of the best models is only marginally better than the prediction accuracy of a basic one-step lag predictor. This result highlights the difficulty of the modelling task and, in general, the difficulty of building reliable predictors for financial markets.},

Forecasting methods are typically designed to cope with temporal dependencies among observations, but it is widely accepted that none is universally applicable. Therefore, a common solution to these tasks is to combine the opinion of a diverse set of forecasts. In this paper we present an approach based on arbitrating, in which several forecasting models are dynamically combined to obtain predictions. Arbitrating is a metalearning approach that combines the output of experts according to predictions of the loss that they will incur. We present an approach for retrieving out-of-bag predictions that significantly improves its data efficiency. Finally, since diversity is a fundamental component in ensemble methods, we propose a method for explicitly handling the inter-dependence between experts when aggregating their predictions. Results from extensive empirical experiments provide evidence of the method competitiveness relative to state of the art approaches. The proposed method is publicly available in a software package.},

  abstract       = {While the predictive advantage of ensemble methods is nowadays widely accepted, the most appropriate way of estimating the weights of each individual model remains an open research question. Meanwhile, several studies report that combining different ensemble approaches leads to improvements in performance, due to a better trade-off between the diversity and the error of the individual models in the ensemble. We contribute to this research line by proposing an aggregation framework for a set of independently created forecasting models, i.e. heterogeneous ensembles. The general idea is to, instead of directly aggregating these models, first rearrange them into different subsets, creating a new set of combined models which is then aggregated into a final decision. We present this idea as constructive aggregation, and apply it to time series forecasting problems. Results from empirical experiments show that applying constructive aggregation to state of the art dynamic aggregation methods provides a consistent advantage.

  abstract       = {Cyber-physical systems often consist of entities that interact with each other over time. Meanwhile, as part of the continued digitization of industrial processes, various sensor technologies are deployed that enable us to record time-varying attributes (a.k.a., time series) of such entities, thus producing correlated time series. To enable accurate forecasting on such correlated time series, this paper proposes two models that combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The first model employs a CNN on each individual time series, combines the convoluted features, and then applies an RNN on top of the convoluted features in the end to enable forecasting. The second model adds additional auto-encoders into the individual CNNs, making the second model a multi-task learning model, which provides accurate and robust forecasting. Experiments on two real-world correlated time series data set suggest that the proposed two models are effective and outperform baselines in most settings. This report extends the paper "Correlated Time Series Forecasting using Multi-Task Deep Neural Networks," to appear in ACM CIKM 2018, by providing additional experimental results.},

  abstract       = {Discovering temporal lagged and inter-dependencies in multivariate time series data is an important task. However, in many real-world applications, such as commercial cloud management, manufacturing predictive maintenance, and portfolios performance analysis, such dependencies can be non-linear and time-variant, which makes it more challenging to extract such dependencies through traditional methods such as Granger causality or clustering. In this work, we present a novel deep learning model that uses multiple layers of customized gated recurrent units (GRUs) for discovering both time lagged behaviors as well as inter-timeseries dependencies in the form of directed weighted graphs. We introduce a key component of Dual-purpose recurrent neural network that decodes information in the temporal domain to discover lagged dependencies within each time series, and encodes them into a set of vectors which, collected from all component time series, form the informative inputs to discover inter-dependencies. Though the discovery of two types of dependencies are separated at different hierarchical levels, they are tightly connected and jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. With this joint training, learning of one type of dependency immediately impacts the learning of the other one, leading to overall accurate dependencies discovery. We empirically test our model on synthetic time series data in which the exact form of (non-linear) dependencies is known. We also evaluate its performance on two real-world applications, (i) performance monitoring data from a commercial cloud provider, which exhibit highly dynamic, non-linear, and volatile behavior and, (ii) sensor data from a manufacturing plant. We further show how our approach is able to capture these dependency behaviors via intuitive and interpretable dependency graphs and use them to generate highly accurate forecasts.},

In finance, several of this quantities of interests (stock valuations, return, volatility) have been shown to be mutually influencing each other, making the prediction of such quantities a difficult task, especially while dealing with an high number of variables and multiple horizons in the future. Here we propose a machine learning based framework, the DFML, based on the Dynamic Factor Model, to first perform a dimensionality reduction and then perform a multiple step ahead forecasting of a reduced number of components. Finally, the components are transformed again into an high dimensional space, providing the desired forecast. Our results, comparing the DFML with several state of the art techniques from different domanins (PLS, RNN, LSTM, DFM), on both traditional stock markets and cryptocurrencies market and for different families of volatility proxies show that the DFML outperforms the concurrent methods, especially for longer horizons. We conclude by explaining how we wish to further improve the performances of the framework, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.},

Then substituting the currently observed context and normalizing density to 1, we get predicted probability distribution for the current value. In contrast to standard machine learning approaches like neural networks, optimal polynomial coefficients here have inexpensive direct formula, have controllable accuracy, are unique and independently calculated, each has a specific cumulant-like interpretation, and such approximation can asymptotically approach complete description of any real joint distribution - providing universal tool to quantitatively describe and exploit statistical dependencies in time series, systematically enhancing ARMA/ARCH-like approaches, also based on different distributions than Gaussian which turns out improper for daily log returns. There is also discussed application for non-stationary time series like calculating linear time trend, or adapting coefficients to local statistical behavior.},

Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in forecasting techniques and applications, from computer-assisted model- and assumption-based to data-driven and fully-automated. This shift can be attributed to the availability of large, rich, and diverse time series corpora and result in a set of challenges that need to be addressed such as the following. How can we build statistical models to efficiently and effectively learn to forecast from large and diverse data sources? How can we leverage the statistical power of "similar'' time series to improve forecasts in the case of limited observations? What are the implications for building forecasting systems that can handle large data volumes? The objective of this tutorial is to provide a concise and intuitive overview of the most important methods and tools available for solving large-scale forecasting problems. We review the state of the art in three related fields: (1) classical modeling of time series, (2) scalable tensor methods, and (3) deep learning for forecasting. Further, we share lessons learned from building scalable forecasting systems. While our focus is on providing an intuitive overview of the methods and practical issues which we will illustrate via case studies, we also present some technical details underlying these powerful tools.},

The dimensionality was first reduced via a high-dimensional factor model implemented by the principal component analysis. Using the extracted factors, we develop a novel forecasting method called the sufficient forecasting, which provides a set of sufficient predictive indices, inferred from high-dimensional predictors, to deliver additional predictive power. The projected principal component analysis will be employed to enhance the accuracy of inferred factors when a semi-parametric factor model is assumed. Our method is also applicable to cross-sectional sufficient regression using extracted factors. The connection between the sufficient forecasting and the deep learning architecture is explicitly stated. The sufficient forecasting correctly estimates projection indices of the underlying factors even in the presence of a nonparametric forecasting function. The proposed method extends the sufficient dimension reduction to high-dimensional regimes by condensing the cross-sectional information through factor models. We derive asymptotic properties for the estimate of the central subspace spanned by these projection directions as well as the estimates of the sufficient predictive indices. We further show that the natural method of running multiple regression of target on estimated factors yields a linear estimate that actually falls into this central subspace. Our method and theory allow the number of predictors to be larger than the number of observations. We finally demonstrate that the sufficient forecasting improves upon the linear forecasting in both simulation studies and an empirical study of forecasting macroeconomic variables.},

  abstract       = {We propose a novel data-driven approach for solving multi-horizon probabilistic forecasting tasks that predicts the full distribution of a time series on future horizons. We illustrate that temporal patterns hidden in historical information play an important role in accurate forecasting of long time series. Traditional methods rely on setting up temporal dependencies manually to explore related patterns in historical data, which is unrealistic in forecasting long-term series on real-world data. Instead, we propose to explicitly learn constructing hidden patterns' representations with deep neural networks and attending to different parts of the history for forecasting the future. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep-learning framework for multi-horizon time series forecasting, with temporal attention mechanisms to better capture latent patterns in historical data which are useful in predicting the future. Forecasts of multiple quantiles on multiple future horizons can be generated simultaneously based on the learned latent pattern features. We also propose a multimodal fusion mechanism which is used to combine features from different parts of the history to better represent the future. Experiment results demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale forecasting datasets in different domains.},

With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state of the art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state of the art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8,730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

  abstract       = {The macroeconomic climate influences operations with regard to, e.g., raw material prices, financing, supply chain utilization and demand quotas. In order to adapt to the economic environment, decision-makers across the public and private sectors require accurate forecasts of the economic outlook. Existing predictive frameworks base their forecasts primarily on time series analysis, as well as the judgments of experts. As a consequence, current approaches are often biased and prone to error. In order to reduce forecast errors, this paper presents an innovative methodology that extends lag variables with unstructured data in the form of financial news: (1) we apply a variety of models from machine learning to word counts as a high-dimensional input. However, this approach suffers from low interpretability and overfitting, motivating the following remedies. (2) We follow the intuition that the economic climate is driven by general sentiments and suggest a projection of words onto latent semantic structures as a means of feature engineering. (3) We propose a semantic path model, together with estimation technique based on regularization, in order to yield full interpretability of the forecasts. We demonstrate the predictive performance of our approach by utilizing 80,813 ad hoc announcements in order to make long-term forecasts of up to 24 months ahead regarding key macroeconomic indicators. Back-testing reveals a considerable reduction in forecast errors.},

Unlike the M3, which included only one ML method (an automatic artificial neural network that performed poorly), M4 49 participants included eight that used either pure ML approaches, or ML in conjunction with statistical methods. The six pure (or combination of pure) ML methods again fared poorly, with all of them falling below the Comb benchmark that combined three simple time series methods. However, utilizing ML either in combination with statistical methods (and for selecting weightings) or in a hybrid model with exponential smoothing not only exceeded the benchmark, but performed at the top. While these promising results by no means prove ML to be a panacea, they do challenge the notion that complex methods do not add value to the forecasting process.},

The algorithm is intuitive and simple to implement, and easily incorporates salient features of the real-time nowcasting environment, such as differences in data reporting lags across series. We evaluate the algorithm's real-time ability to establish new business cycle turning points in the United States quickly and accurately over the past five NBER recessions.

Importantly, we investigate the benefits of interval combination using six recently-proposed heuristics that can be applied prior to learning about the realizations of the quantities. Our results suggest that interval aggregation offers improvements in terms of both calibration and accuracy. While averaging interval endpoints maintains its practical appeal as being simple to implement and performs quite well when data sets are large, the median and the interior trimmed average are found to be robust aggregators for the prediction interval submissions across all 100,000 time series.},

  abstract             = {In this thesis, I study high-dimensional nonlinear time series analysis, and its applications in financial forecasting and identifying risk in highly interconnected financial networks. The first chapter is devoted to the testing for nonlinearity in financial time series. I present a tentative classification of the various linearity tests that have been proposed in the literature. Then I investigate nonlinear features of real financial series to determine if the data justify the use of nonlinear techniques, such as those inspired by machine learning theories. In Chapter 3 and 5, I develop forecasting strategies with a high-dimensional panel of predictors while considering nonlinear dynamics. Combining these two elements is a developing area of research. In the third chapter, I propose a nonlinear generalization of the statistical factor models. As a first step, factor estimation, I employ an auto-associative neural network to estimate nonlinear factors from predictors. In the second step, forecasting equation, I apply a nonlinear function -feedforward neural networkon estimated factors for prediction. I show that these features can go beyond covariance analysis and enhance forecast accuracy. I apply this approach to forecast equity returns, and show that capturing nonlinear dynamics between equities significantly improves the quality of forecasts over current univariate and multivariate factor models. In Chapter 5, I propose a high-dimensional learning based on a shrinkage estimation of a backpropagation algorithm for skip-layer neural networks. This thesis emphasizes that linear models can be represented as special cases of these two aforementioned models, which basically means that if there is no nonlinearity between series, the proposed models will reduce to a linear model. This thesis also includes a chapter (chapter 4, with Negar Kiyavash and Seyedjalal Etesami), which in this chapter, we propose a new approach for identifying and measuring systemic risk in financial networks by introducing a nonlinearly modified Granger-causality network based on directed information graphs. The suggested method allows for nonlinearity and has predictive power over future economic activity through a time-varying network of interconnections. We apply the method to the daily returns of U.S. financial Institutions including banks, brokers and insurance companiesto identifythe level of systemic risk inthe financial sector and the contribution of each financial institution.},

Many statistical methods and traditional machine learning techniques are commonly used for forecasting time series. With the development of deep learning in artificial intelligence, many researchers have adopted new models from artificial neural networks for forecasting time series. However, poor performance of applying deep learning models in short time series hinders the accuracy in time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to alleviate this problem based on transfer learning. Existing work on transfer learning uses extracted features from a source dataset for prediction task in a target dataset. In this paper, we propose a new training strategy for time-series transfer learning with two source datasets that outperform existing approaches. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on financial time series extracted from stock markets. Experiment results show that transfer learning based on 2 data sets is superior than other base-line methods.},

The ML methodology employed significantly affects forecasting accuracy. Market maturity, forecast horizon and model-assessment method affect forecast accuracy. Evidence against the informational value of technical indicators. Financial time series forecasting is a popular application of machine learning methods. Previous studies report that advanced forecasting methods predict price changes in financial markets with high accuracy and that profit can be made trading on these predictions. However, financial economists point to the informational efficiency of financial markets, which questions price predictability and opportunities for profitable trading. The objective of the paper is to resolve this contradiction. To this end, we undertake an extensive forecasting simulation, based on data from thirty-four financial indices over six years. These simulations confirm that the best machine learning methods produce more accurate forecasts than the best econometric methods. We also examine the methodological factors that impact the predictive accuracy of machine learning forecasting experiments. The results suggest that the predictability of a financial market and the feasibility of profitable model-based trading are significantly influenced by the maturity of the market, the forecasting method employed, the horizon for which it generates predictions and the methodology used to assess the model and simulate model-based trading. We also find evidence against the informational value of indicators from the field of technical analysis. Overall, we confirm that advanced forecasting methods can be used to predict price changes in some financial markets and we discuss whether these results question the prevailing view in the financial economics literature that financial markets are efficient.},

In this paper, we study causal discovery and forecasting for nonstationary time series. By exploiting a particular type of state-space model to represent the processes, we show that nonstationarity helps to identify causal structure and that forecasting naturally benefits from learned causal knowledge. Specifically, we allow changes in both causal strengths and noise variances in the nonlinear state-space models, which, interestingly, renders both the causal structure and model parameters identifiable. Given the causal model, we treat forecasting as a problem in Bayesian inference in the causal model, which exploits the timevarying property of the data and adapts to new observations in a principled manner. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.},

However, the performance of DL models can degenerate rapidly if the data are not appropriately normalized. This issue is even more apparent when DL is used for financial time series forecasting tasks, where the non-stationary and multimodal nature of the data pose significant challenges and severely affect the performance of DL models. In this work, a simple, yet effective, neural layer, that is capable of adaptively normalizing the input time series, while taking into account the distribution of the data, is proposed. The proposed layer is trained in an end-to-end fashion using back-propagation and leads to significant performance improvements compared to other evaluated normalization schemes. The proposed method differs from traditional normalization methods since it learns how to perform normalization for a given task instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. At the same time, it can be directly applied to any new time series without requiring re-training. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a large-scale limit order book dataset, as well as a load forecasting dataset.},

We demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy in investment decision making while memory is addressed in an explainable way. Our approach introduces novel remember cues, consisting of empirically learned change points in the absolute error series of the FFNN. Memory recall is also novel, with contextual similarity assessed over time by sampling distances using dynamic time warping (DTW). We demonstrate the benefits of our approach by using it in an expected return forecasting task to drive investment decisions. In an investment simulation in a broad international equity universe between 2003-2017, our approach significantly outperforms FFNN base models. We also illustrate how CLA's memory addressing works in practice, using a worked example to demonstrate the explainability of our approach.},

While machine learning algorithms offer a proven way of modeling non-linearities in time series, their advantages against common stochastic models in the domain of financial market prediction are largely based on limited empirical results. The same holds true for determining advantages of certain machine learning architectures against others. This study surveys more than 150 related articles on applying machine learning to financial market forecasting. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we build a table across seven main parameters describing the experiments conducted in these studies. Through listing and classifying different algorithms, we also introduce a simple, standardized syntax for textually representing machine learning algorithms. Based on performance metrics gathered from papers included in the survey, we further conduct rank analyses to assess the comparative performance of different algorithm classes. Our analysis shows that machine learning algorithms tend to outperform most traditional stochastic methods in financial market forecasting. We further find evidence that, on average, recurrent neural networks outperform feed forward neural networks as well as support vector machines which implies the existence of exploitable temporal dependencies in financial time series across multiple asset classes and geographies.},

  abstract             = {Yield curve forecasting is an important problem in finance. In this work we explore the use of Gaussian Processes in conjunction with a dynamic modeling strategy, much like the Kalman Filter, to model the yield curve. Gaussian Processes have been successfully applied to model functional data in a variety of applications. A Gaussian Process is used to model the yield curve. The hyper-parameters of the Gaussian Process model are updated as the algorithm receives yield curve data. Yield curve data is typically available as a time series with a frequency of one day. We compare existing methods to forecast the yield curve with the proposed method. The results of this study showed that while a competing method (a multivariate time series method) performed well in forecasting the yields at the short term structure region of the yield curve, Gaussian Processes perform well in the medium and long term structure regions of the yield curve. Accuracy in the long term structure region of the yield curve has important practical implications. The Gaussian Process framework yields uncertainty and probability estimates directly in contrast to other competing methods. Analysts are frequently interested in this information. In this study the proposed method has been applied to yield curve forecasting, however it can be applied to model high frequency time series data or data streams in other domains.},

  abstract       = {Academics and practitioners have developed many models for volatility measurement and forecast - I estimate that the total number of available models to be about 200-300 if we count all modifications of intraday estimators, GARCH-type and continuous-time models. In practice, the estimate and forecast of the volatility serves provide vital inputs to many applications ranging from signal construction to algorithmic strategies and quantitative methods for portfolio allocation. By applying machine learning to the volatility modeling, we can reduce the back-test bias and, as a result, improve the performance of live strategies. First, I implemented about 40 different volatility models from 4 separate model classes including intraday estimators, GARCH-type and Bayesian models, and Hidden Markov Chain (HMC) models. Then, I applied the supervised learning for each of the volatility models with the goal is to analyze the out-of-sample fit of the model prediction to the time series data. I propose a few regression-based tests which are applied to gauge the performance of all volatility models. The final step is the reinforcement learning that includes aggregation and analysis of the test results from the supervised learning. The goal is to dynamically select the best model out of 40 that provides the best predicative power out-of-sample. I use the analogy to the web-search to weight the importance of the test results when producing volatility forecasts for specific trading algorithms. One of key discoveries is that Hidden Markov Chain model is one of the best model for volatility forecast across many asset classes. I also observe the cyclical pattern in the rankings of the best models. On one hand, Hidden Chain models perform the best in periods with strong trends. On the other hand, simple intraday estimators perform the best in periods with range-bound markets. The machine learning enables to dynamically choose the best model for the present cycle.},

Inspired by classification and pattern recognition algorithms, this work presents a dynamic selection method of forecast combiners. In the dynamic selection, each test pattern is submitted to a certain combiner according to a nearest neighbor rule. The proposed method was used to forecast eight time series with chaotic behavior in short and long term. In general, the dynamic selection presented satisfactory results for all datasets.},

This study explores how the performance of the predictive system depends on a combination of a forecast horizon and an input window length for forecasting variable horizons. Technical indicators are used as input features for machine learning algorithms to forecast future directions of stock price movements. The dataset consists of ten years daily price time series for fifty stocks. The highest prediction performance is observed when the input window length is approximately equal to the forecast horizon. This novel pattern is studied using multiple performance metrics: prediction accuracy, winning rate, return per trade and Sharpe ratio.},

  abstract       = {Forecasting time series data is an important subject in economics, business, and finance. Traditionally, there are several techniques to effectively forecast the next lag of time series data such as univariate Autoregressive (AR), univariate Moving Average (MA), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), and more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with its many variations. In particular, ARIMA model has demonstrated its outperformance in precision and accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series. With the recent advancement in computational power of computers and more importantly developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as deep learning, new algorithms are developed to forecast time series data. The research question investigated in this article is that whether and how the newly developed deep learning-based algorithms for forecasting time series data, such as "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)", are superior to the traditional algorithms. The empirical studies conducted and reported in this article show that deep learning-based algorithms such as LSTM outperform traditional-based algorithms such as ARIMA model. More specifically, the average reduction in error rates obtained by LSTM is between 84 - 87 percent when compared to ARIMA indicating the superiority of LSTM to ARIMA. Furthermore, it was noticed that the number of training times, known as "epoch" in deep learning, has no effect on the performance of the trained forecast model and it exhibits a truly random behavior.},

Methods applied in digital signal processing can be applied to stock data as both are time series. Similarly, learning outcome of this paper can be applied to speech time series data. Deep learning for stock prediction has been introduced in this paper and its performance is evaluated on Google stock price multimedia data (chart) from NASDAQ. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that deep learning can improve stock market forecasting accuracy. For this, (2D)2PCA + Deep Neural Network (DNN) method is compared with state of the art method 2-Directional 2-Dimensional Principal Component Analysis (2D)2PCA + Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). It is found that the proposed method is performing better than the existing method RBFNN with an improved accuracy of 4.8\% for Hit Rate with a window size of 20. Also the results of the proposed model are compared with the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and it is found that the accuracy for Hit Rate is improved by 15.6\%. The correlation coefficient between the actual and predicted return for DNN is 17.1\% more than RBFNN and it is 43.4\% better than RNN.},

Firstly, by using AdaBoost algorithm the database is trained to get the training samples. Secondly, the LSTM is utilized to forecast each training sample separately. Thirdly, AdaBoost algorithm is used to integrate the forecasting results of all the LSTM predictors to generate the ensemble results. Two major daily exchange rate datasets and two stock market index datasets are selected for model evaluation and comparison. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble learning approach outperforms some other single forecasting models and ensemble learning approaches. This suggests that the AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble learning approach is a highly promising approach for financial time series data forecasting, especially for the time series data with nonlinearity and irregularity, such as exchange rates and stock indexes.},

Hierarchical forecasting require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the coherency between different levels - the property that forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy. A fundamental limitation of prior research is the focus on forecasting the mean of each time series. We consider the situation where probabilistic forecasts are needed for each series in the hierarchy, and propose an algorithm to compute predictive distributions rather than mean forecasts only. Our algorithm has the advantage of synthesizing information from different levels in the hierarchy through a sparse forecast combination and a probabilistic hierarchical aggregation. We evaluate the accuracy of our forecasting algorithm on both simulated data and large-scale electricity smart meter data. The results show consistent performance gains compared to state-of-the art methods.},

  abstract             = {Forecasting financial time-series has long been among the most challenging problems in financial market analysis. In order to recognize the correct circumstances to enter or exit the markets investors usually employ statistical models (or even simple qualitative methods). However, the inherently noisy and stochastic nature of markets severely limits the forecasting accuracy of the used models. The introduction of electronic trading and the availability of large amounts of data allow for developing novel machine learning techniques that address some of the difficulties faced by the aforementioned methods. In this work we propose a deep learning methodology, based on recurrent neural networks, that can be used for predicting future price movements from large-scale high-frequency time-series data on Limit Order Books. The proposed method is evaluated using a large-scale dataset of limit order book events.},

  abstract             = {This thesis comprises four self-contained chapters on the econometric analysis of stochastic asset return volatility.

The first chapter treats estimation of asset return volatility using high-frequency, i.e. tick-by-tick, financial data. In this context, one may quantify the ex-post variability of logarithmic asset returns using the concept of quadratic variation and estimate the latter precisely over a fixed horizon, say one trading day, as the sampling interval between successive observations progressively shrinks. However, when using tick-by-tick data, the observable asset prices deviate from their theoretical counterparts due to market microstructure (MMS) noise, which summarizes an array of market imperfections such as bid-ask bounce effects, asymmetric information and strategic learning, execution of block trades, etc. As a result, previous estimators in this literature are either inconsistent, consistent with optimal asymptotic properties under high-level assumptions on the MMS noise, or consistent with sub-optimal asymptotic properties under general assumptions on the MMS noise.

The second chapter extends the analysis in Chapter 1 to a multivariate setting where the asset prices are not only contaminated by MMS noise, but they are also allowed to be observed randomly and non-synchronously. In this setting, the flat-top realized kernels are shown to estimate the quadratic covariation matrix with asymptotic properties that resemble those described above for the univariate case. A simple finite sample correction based on projections of symmetric matrices that ensures positive definiteness of the estimators without altering their asymptotic properties is also proposed. An empirically motivated simulation study demonstrates that the flat-top realized kernels have a desirable combination of robustness and efficiency relative to competing estimators. Finally, an empirical analysis for a portfolio of six stocks of varying size and liquidity illustrates that the use of flat-top realized kernels leads to better in-sample signal detection and out-of-sample predictions of the quadratic covariation matrix compared to other estimators in the literature. Once we have a time series of, for example, daily asset return volatility estimates, the third chapter - co-authored with Professor Pierre Perron (Boston University) - is concerned with its dynamic modeling and forecasting. In particular, we propose a parametric state space model of asset return volatility with an accompanying estimation and forecasting framework that allows for ARFIMA dynamics, random level shifts, and measurement errors. The Kalman filter is first used to construct the state-augmented likelihood function and subsequently to generate forecasts, which are mean- and path-corrected. We apply our model to eight daily volatility series constructed from both high-frequency and daily returns, covering three asset classes. We find that random level shifts are present in all series, while genuine long memory is only present in the series constructed from high-frequency data. Finally, we show that our model provides significant gains in forecast accuracy relative to competing models in the literature. These gains can be very pronounced, especially at longer forecast horizons},

Classical time series models fail to capture complex patterns in the data and multivariate techniques struggle to scale to large problem sizes, but their reliance on strong structural assumptions makes them data-efficient and allows them to provide estimates of uncertainty. The converse is true for models based on deep neural networks, which can learn complex patterns and dependencies given enough data. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that incorporates the benefits of both approaches. Our new method is data-driven and scalable via a latent, global, deep component. It also handles uncertainty through a local classical model. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence for the soundness of our approach through a necessary and sufficient decomposition of exchangeable time series into a global and a local part and extensive experiments. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our model both in term of data efficiency and computational complexity.},

  abstract       = {The selection of relevant factor set is essential for obtaining a financial forecasting model with high information coefficient (IC), and is challenging due to the non-trivial interaction between factors and their vast combinatorial search space. We introduce a factor selection algorithm using a value network to evaluate the ICs of factor sets. With the fitness function provided by the network evaluation, a genetic algorithm is employed to select a population of candidate factor sets. The ICs of these sets are computed with historical time series data, and the results are subsequently used to train the value network. Such reinforcement iteration can be employed repeatedly to simultaneously improve both the best IC and value network evaluation accuracy. Our approach is generic to any prediction model involving factor selection. To characterize the performance of our algorithm, we employed a typical robust linear regression model with commonly available factors. Although the algorithm's learning process is much like a black-box, the optimal results it delivered can in fact provide useful insights to quantitative researchers. With standard factors available in the financial industry, we achieved a monthly IC of 0.070 on the global market. In comparison, the forward selection and backward elimination algorithms achieved monthly IC of less than 0.05. With a simple portfolio rebalance strategy (monthly rebalance [long/short] with equal weight of the stocks in the [top/bottom] decile of the predicted return), the investment portfolio resulted from our prediction model achieved an average annualized return of 31.17\% with annualized standard deviation of 18.39\% on the global market for 2004-2016.},

In this paper, we extend the MKL capability to select the optimal size of sliding windows for time series domain by adopting the data integration approach which has been previously studied in the domain of image processing. In this study, each kernel represents the different lengths of time series lag. In addition, we also examine the feasibility of MKL for decomposed time series. We use the dataset from previous time series competitions as our benchmark. Our experimental results indicate that our approaches perform competitively compared to the previous methods using the same dataset. Furthermore, MKL may predict the detrended time series without explicitly computing the seasonality. The advantage of our method is in its ability in automatically selecting the optimal size of sliding windows and finding the pattern of time series.},

The advantages of ELM in efficiency and generalization performance over traditional fuzzy neural network(FNN) algorithms have been demonstrated on a wide range of problems from different fields, thanks to the integration of l2,1-norm, the l2,1 RF-ELM is able to automatically prune the irrelevant and redundant hidden neurons to form a more discriminative and compact hidden layer. The performance of the l2,1RF-ELM is compared with other hidden layer enforcement algorithms, two long-term time series data sets, including TianChi and BCS, are used for this comparison. The performance of the l2,1RF-ELM was comparable to those of other widely used machine learning techniques like support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN) and other popular ELM method. The experiments demonstrate favorable prediction results of the l2,1RF-ELM in terms of annualized return, prediction error and running time.

  abstract       = {Hierarchical time series is a set of time series organized by aggregation constraints and it is widely used in many real-world applications. Usually, hierarchical time series forecasting can be realized with a two-step method, in which all time series are forecasted independently and then the forecasting results are reconciled to satisfy aggregation consistency. However, these two-step methods have a high computational complexity and are unable to ensure optimal forecasts for all time series. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical forecasting approach to solve the above problems. Based on multi-task learning, we construct an integrated model that combines features of the bottom level series and the hierarchical structure. Then forecasts of all time series are output simultaneously and they are aggregated consistently. The model has the advantage of utilizing the correlation between time series. And the forecasting results are overall optimal by optimizing a global loss function. In order to avoid the curse of dimensionality as the number of time series grows larger, we further learn a sparse model with group sparsity and element-wise sparsity constraints according to data characteristics. The experimental results on simulation data and tourism data demonstrate that our method has a better overall performance while simplifying forecasting process.},

  abstract       = {Abstract Recently, many excellent algorithms for time series prediction issues have been proposed, most of which are developed based on the assumption that sufficient training data and testing data under the same distribution are available. However, in reality, time-series data usually exhibit some kind of time-varying characteristic, which may lead to a wide variability between old data and new data. Hence, how to transfer knowledge over a long time span, when addressing time series prediction issues, poses serious challenges. To solve this problem, in this paper, a hybrid algorithm based on transfer learning, Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine with Kernels (OS-ELMK), and ensemble learning, abbreviated as TrEnOS-ELMK, is proposed, along with its precise mathematic derivation. It aims to make the most of, rather than discard, the adequate long-ago data, and constructs an algorithm framework for transfer learning in time series forecasting, which is groundbreaking. Inspired by the preferable performance of models ensemble, ensemble learning scheme is also incorporated into our proposed algorithm, where the weights of the constituent models are adaptively updated according to their performances on fresh samples. Compared to many existing time series prediction methods, the newly proposed algorithm takes long-ago data into consideration and can effectively leverage the latent knowledge implied in these data for current prediction. In addition, TrEnOS-ELMK naturally inherits merits of both OS-ELMK and ensemble learning due to its incorporation of the two techniques. Experimental results on three synthetic and six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

A full structural changepoint specification is defined in which all parameters of the conditional variance of the volatility models are dynamic.

A performance metric can be defined as a logical and mathematical construct designed to measure how close are the actual results from what has been expected or predicted. A vast variety of performance metrics have been described in academic literature. The most commonly mentioned metrics in research studies are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc. Knowledge about metrics properties needs to be systematized to simplify the design and use of the metrics. Methodology: A qualitative study was conducted to achieve the objectives of identifying related peer-reviewed research studies, literature reviews, critical thinking and inductive reasoning. Contribution: The main contribution of this paper is in ordering knowledge of performance metrics and enhancing understanding of their structure and properties by proposing a new typology, generic primary metrics mathematical formula and a visualization chart Findings: Based on the analysis of the structure of numerous performance metrics, we proposed a framework of metrics which includes four (4) categories: primary metrics, extended metrics, composite metrics, and hybrid sets of metrics. The paper identified three (3) key components (dimensions) that determine the structure and properties of primary metrics: method of determining point distance, method of normalization, method of aggregation of point distances over a data set. For each component, implementation options have been identified. The suggested new typology has been shown to cover a total of over 40 commonly used primary metrics Recommendations for Practitioners: Presented findings can be used to facilitate teaching performance metrics to university students and expedite metrics selection and implementation processes for practitioners Recommendation for Researchers: By using the proposed typology, researchers can streamline development of new metrics with predetermined properties Impact on Society: The outcomes of this study could be used for improving evaluation results in machine learning regression, forecasting and prognostics with direct or indirect positive impacts on innovation and productivity in a societal sense Future Research: Future research is needed to examine the properties of the extended metrics, composite metrics, and hybrid sets of metrics. Empirical study of the metrics is needed using R Studio or Azure Machine Learning Studio, to find associations between the properties of primary metrics and their behavior in a wide spectrum of data characteristics and business or research requirements},

  abstract             = {Examine differences in models' forecast accuracy observation by observation. Forecast accuracy measures based on error averaging (e.g. MSFE) may be misleading. Recursively computed measures of forecast accuracy are more informative. The fact that the predictive performance of models used in forecasting stock returns, exchange rates, and macroeconomic variables is not stable and varies over time has been widely documented in the forecasting literature. Under these circumstances excessive reliance on forecast evaluation metrics that ignores this instability in forecasting accuracy, like squared errors averaged over the whole forecast evaluation sample, masks important information regarding the temporal evolution of relative forecasting performance of competing models. In this paper we suggest an approach based on the combination of the Cumulated Sum of Squared Forecast Error Differential (CSSFED) of Welch and Goyal (2008) and the Bayesian change point analysis of Barry and Hartigan (1993) that tracks the contribution of forecast errors to the aggregate measures of forecast accuracy observation by observation. In doing so, it allows one to track the evolution of the relative forecasting performance over time. We illustrate the suggested approach by using forecasts of the GDP growth rate in Switzerland.},

Accordingly, the appropriate accuracy metric will assess the difference between the actual and forecasted distributions of demand".

The issue has not had much traction over the years since - except perhaps in energy studies - and we do not find error metrics based on full distributions present in forecasting support systems.

Now Stefan de Kok picks up the argument and extends it to develop an error metric- Total Percentage Error- that measures the full range of uncertainty in our forecasts and, in doing so, both enables better inventory - planning and provides a more comprehensive way to gauge the quality of the forecast},

Paraphrasing what Sir Clive W.J. Granger (arguably the father of modern day time series forecasting) said in the 1990s at a conference in Svinkloev, Denmark, , the model looks like an interesting extension, but can it forecast better than existing models. Indeed, the forecast evaluation literature continues to expand, with interesting new tests and methods being developed at a rapid pace. In this chapter, we discuss a select a group of predictive accuracy tests and model selection methods that have been developed in recent years, and that are now widely used in the forecasting literature. We begin by reviewing several tests for comparing the relative forecast accuracy of different models, in the case of point forecasts. We then broaden the scope of our discussion by introducing density-based predictive accuracy tests. We conclude by noting that predictive accuracy is typically assessed in terms of a given loss function, such as mean squared forecast error or mean absolute forecast error. Most tests, including those discussed here, are consequently loss function dependent, and the relative forecast superiority of predictive models is therefore also dependent on specification of a loss function. In light of this fact, we conclude this chapter by discussing loss function robust predictive density accuracy tests that have recently been developed using principles of stochastic dominance.},

  abstract       = {Forecasts play a critical role at inflation-targeting central banks, such as the Bank of England. Breaks in the forecast performance of a model can potentially incur important policy costs. Commonly used statistical procedures, however, implicitly put a lot of weight on type I errors (or false positives), which result in a relatively low power of tests to identify forecast breakdowns in small samples. We develop a procedure which aims at capturing the policy cost of missing a break. We use data-based rules to find the test size that optimally trades off the costs associated with false positives with those that can result from a break going undetected for too long. In so doing, we also explicitly study forecast errors as a multivariate system. The covariance between forecast errors for different series, though often overlooked in the forecasting literature, not only enables us to consider testing in a multivariate setting but also increases the test power. As a result, we can tailor the choice of the critical values for each series not only to the in-sample properties of each series but also to how the series for forecast errors covary.},

We address these questions by evaluating the predictive ability of a wide range of economic variables for two key US macroeconomic aggregates, industrial production and inflation, relative to simple benchmarks. We find that business indicators, financial conditions, uncertainty as well as measures of past relative performance are generally useful for explaining the relative forecasting performance of the models. We further conduct a pseudo-real-time forecasting exercise, where we use the information about the conditional performance for model selection and model averaging. The newly proposed strategies deliver sizable improvements over competitive benchmark models and commonly used combination schemes. Gains are larger when model selection and averaging are based on financial conditions as well as past performance measured at the forecast origin date.},

Parsimonious model specifi cations typically outperform richer model specifications. Consequently, there is often predictable information in forecast errors that is difficult to exploit. However, we show how this predictable information can be exploited in forecast combinations. Optimal combination weights should minimize conditional mean squared error, or a conditional loss function, rather than the unconditional variance as in the commonly used framework of Bates and Granger (1969). We prove that our conditionally optimal weights lead to better forecast performance than other approaches. The conditionally optimal weights support forward-looking approaches to combining forecasts, where the forecast weights depend on the expected model performance. We show that a forward-looking approach can robustly outperform other strategies, including equal weights, in real-time out-of-sample forecasting exercises for a range of macroaggregates in advanced economies.},

However, as a consequence of the use of misspecified models in multiple model comparisons, relative forecast rankings are loss function dependent. This paper addresses this issue by using a novel criterion for forecast evaluation which is based on the entire distribution of forecast errors.

We introduce the concepts of general-loss (GL) forecast superiority and convex-loss (CL) forecast superiority, and we establish a mapping between GL (CL) superiority and first (second) order stochastic dominance. This allows us to develop a forecast evaluation procedure based on an out-of-sample generalization of the tests introduced by Linton, Maasoumi and Whang (2005). The asymptotic null distributions of our test statistics are nonstandard, and resampling procedures are used to obtain the critical values. Additionally, the tests are consistent and have nontrivial local power under a sequence of local alternatives.

In addition to the stationary case, we outline theory extending our tests to the case of heterogeneity induced by distributional change over time. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the tests perform reasonably well in finite samples; and an application to exchange rate data indicates that our tests can help identify superior forecasting models, regardless of loss function.},

Our Monte Carlo simulations show that these methods do not necessarily achieve better forecasting performances than the bias-uncorrected least squares (LS) method, because bias correction increases the variance of the estimator.

Both the bias and the relative variance tend to decrease as the sample size (TT) increases, meaning that larger numbers of observations do not always imply gains from bias-correction. As the degree of persistence increases, the bias becomes greater while the relative variance becomes smaller, which implies a greater gain from correcting for bias for highly persistent data. We also provide real data applications that confirm our major findings overall.},

The purpose of M4 was to replicate the results of the previous ones and extend them into three directions: First significantly increase the number of series, second include Machine Learning (ML) forecasting methods, and third evaluate both point forecasts and prediction intervals. The five major findings of the M4 Competitions are: 1. Out Of the 17 most accurate methods, 12 were of mostly statistical approaches. 2. The biggest surprise was a approach that utilized both statistical and ML features. This method average sMAPE was close to 10\% more accurate than the combination benchmark used to compare the submitted methods. 3. The second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical methods and one ML one, with the weights for the averaging being calculated by a ML algorithm that was trained to minimize the forecasting. 4. The two most accurate methods also achieved an amazing success in specifying the 95\% prediction intervals correctly. 5. The six pure ML methods performed poorly, with none of them being more accurate than the combination benchmark and only one being more accurate than Naive2. This paper presents some initial results of M4, its major findings and a logical conclusion. Finally, it outlines what the authors consider to be the way forward for the field of forecasting.},
